I think it needs to be a 50/50 relationship. You must supply positive interaction while getting the same back.</p><p>And I think I need to cut down on my tooting, because otherwise I’m just in the same place I was when I used Facebook. Also I need more real-life contact with people and this is kind of becoming too…hmm….how do I put it: <strong>addictive</strong></p><p>And in a really bad way.</p><p>The transition is really slow, but slowly you notice how you either: a) slowly shift toward writing what others find interesting. b) suddenly having an awarenes of “a)” happening and bluntly doing the opposite.</p><p>In either case you feel how your sense of “self” starts to fade, and to recover that selfness you need to detox a little. So I might start doing that.</p><p><strong>HOW?</strong> Focusing on less worrying and more on doing, with takes me to the next subject:</p><h2 id="is-worrying-a-useful-feelingaction">Is worrying a useful feeling/action?</h2><p>This morning I took a long detour from the gym back home, I really needed some fresh air and quality me-time. Sometimes the best way to get in contact with yourself is to escape to nature. That doesn’t abound in Seville except in the riverside, both of them.</p><p>And in the process I started thinking, one was about my company of which I’ll talk on the next subject, the other was how much time do I waste worrying and whether I achieve anything meaningful by worrying, at all or is one of those useless feelings.</p><p>I don’t think worrying achieves anything, in fact I’m starting to believe it is a <strong>toxic</strong> action. Why?</p><ul><li>It gives you a fake sense of “doing” something, when you actually aren’t.</li><li>In terms of actions, the only thing it does is to rephrase the problem you have again in again in your head without actually giving you any answers. Wouldn’t it be quicker to write them down in a notepad, than repeating the same action every day?</li><li>The frustration of not having any immediate answers to any of the questions that feed the worrying phase, only paralyse you, damage your self-esteem the more you repeat the same question over a number of days, leads you to nowhere, solves nothing.</li></ul><p>But what would I do instead. I can’t think of those questions without worrying, is not as if one could live a worry free life.</p><p>These are complex questions of which I won’t get any answer quickly. I just think I should cut on the worrying and spend more time doing. If those questions don’t have an answer today, maybe let them settle for a bit on their own while I actually do something useful with the time I would have spent otherwise doing worrying, meaning nothing.</p><p>So what to do instead? How about a course on Elixir, how about more time creating meaningful processes for my company? This leads me to the next subject:</p><h2 id="what-is-maikel-oüs-unique-selling-point-usp">What is Maikel OÜ’s Unique-Selling Point (USP)</h2><p><em>Note: assume whenever you see Maikel with OÜ I mean the company, <strong>not me</strong>. OÜ is Estonian for LTD, it’s the legal full name of the company Maikel Limited = Maikel OÜ. I registered the company in Estonian for the simpified bureacracy</em>*</p><p>My other thought while on my morning escape. The point is <strong>time</strong>, Maikel OÜ is in the business of trading time. What do I mean?</p><p>My company is a funnel, a closed one. I trade on the effiency of the use of time. Companies pay me to do something for them they don’t have the time, patience, to do, for <strong>much less</strong> than will cost them in either time, money or both to be done by them. My skillset and ability to increase it quickly, is their efficiency. This in terms translates in money that translates the other way, hence, the closed loop, in time I get to spend not worrying about how do I feed myself, but reading books, doing courses, increasing my skillset, increasing <strong>the efficiency at which I can produce that time they save</strong>. Doing the courses, increasing my skillset is what makes me happy, this is why I’m into IT, because what makes me happy does actually save others time, headaches <strong>and money</strong>.</p><p>I’m going to have to learn Minio inside out (not necessarily but I know I will) to create a simple automation of development of a 3-node cluster and I’m eager to begin not because of the money I’ll earn (which is laughable and buys me very little time) but because of the pleasure I know I’ll derive from the learning of this and the extra pleasure I know I will get from knowing doing something I love will solve someone else’s problem.</p><p>That’s my selling point.</p><p>Which means I’ll never be a big company. Maikel OÜ will never expand. In the far future it might have someone doing secretarial bits, so I can get rid of Xolo, and that person might be in charge of bring business in, but I won’t grow, I will always be a small business since my dedication is on both time saved for my clients and time obtained for my learning. I might and surely will collaborate with others, that’s the whole idea of getting work through referrals (which is on itself not easy, you <strong>must be good</strong> to get those referrals), I don’t want to grow.</p><p>I want my clients to grow.</p><p>I want them to think of me for their problems while they grow.</p><p>I want to build business <strong>loyalty</strong>.</p><h2 id="company-has-now-eu-vat-id">Company has now EU Vat ID</h2><p>I don’t have to apply for EU Vat ID because as per Estonian law, I don’t have to pay VAT until I reach 40 thousand euros per year. That means all my invoices are vatless. But that doesn’t mean I can’t apply earlier. It is not illegal to have VAT ID before I need it. It is only Xolo, my accountants, that prefer we don’t as that means more paperwork for them. For me it makes no difference since it’s included in what I pay them every month.</p><p>I was about to lose some work due to not having a VAT ID so I applied for it and now in theory Maikel OÜ has VAT ID EE102644089</p><p></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mkl.lol/files/291d1c4d-a75b-4386-8627-b142217dfe09" alt="Vat ID" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p></p><p>And I say in theory because that number seems to not have propagated yet, I guess it might take a couple of days because when I search it in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/#/vat-validation">this database</a> it still shows as non-valid.</p><h3 id="update">Update:</h3><p>Got a message form Kadri from xolo, the VAT ID number is valid from next Wednesday (the 15th).</p><h2 id="back-in-paypal">Back in Paypal</h2><p>I’m back in Paypal with the account <a href="https://paypal.me/maikelthedev">@maikelthedev</a> . I don’t like Paypal at all for company payments but for personal donations is not that bad.</p><p>I’m adding it to the website donations page but I don’t know how quick they are at letting me withdraw the funds. It’s <a href="https://maikel.dev/donations">done now</a> donating with PayPal is now an option.</p><h2 id="developing-a-contract-writing-workflow">Developing a contract-writing workflow</h2><p>I should stop second-guessing myself because after googling “contract software” and reading….</p><ul><li>this <a href="https://www.pandadoc.com/blog/best-contract-management-software/">https://www.pandadoc.com/blog/best-contract-management-software/</a></li><li>this <a href="https://www.makeitfuture.com/automation/contract-generation">https://www.makeitfuture.com/automation/contract-generation</a></li><li>and this <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-apps-to-create-contract-proposal/">https://www.makeuseof.com/best-apps-to-create-contract-proposal/</a></li></ul><p>…what I ultimately learnt is that I already had the best eSigning tool for the job. Hellosign or now called Dropbox Sign.</p><p>So I’ve created a contract model based on this one and the one of Survation in Word document. All I have to do is to edit the clauses. That document is on my Netxdrive.</p><p>So the best tool is actually LibreOffice. Well process done. In the future I’d like to have this all automated on my website.</p><p>This is all for today.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on
