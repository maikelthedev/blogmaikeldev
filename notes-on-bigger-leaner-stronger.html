Follow a proven progression model ; 2. Track your workouts; 3. Adjust your dieting and training as needed.</blockquote><p>I know that above is pretty much basic but it is a good start if I want to actually define and subdivide the process.</p><h2 id="diet">Diet</h2><blockquote>Fat can be liquid (unsaturated) or solid (saturated).</blockquote><p>Notice that peanuts, which have more unsaturated fat than saturated, are completely solid so that definition is a bit strange.</p><blockquote>saturated fat is found in meat, dairy and eggs.</blockquote><p>there you go.</p><p>| unsaturated fat is found in olive oil, avocado and nuts.</p><p>The one below makes thinking pretty simple.</p><blockquote>If you're trying to lose weight but aren't you probably need to eat less or move more.</blockquote><p>About fat loss diets.</p><blockquote>When dieting to lose fat a high-protein, high-carbs diet allows you to push harder in your workouts.</blockquote><p>About protein production</p><blockquote>When you do resistance training or cardio, protein synthesis rates decline then both breakdown and synthesis rates rise after you finish.</blockquote><p>About carbs/fat relationship</p><blockquote>The more dietary fat you eat the less carbs you can eat.</blockquote><h2 id="about-willpower">About Willpower</h2><p>Stress and willpower</p><blockquote>Think about stress management as the nutritional aspect of your willpower</blockquote><blockquote>Anything that causes stress drains our supply of willpower.</blockquote><p>Reducing stress</p><blockquote>Walking, especially walking in nature, is a powerful stress buster.</blockquote><p>Self-control</p><blockquote>People's self-control is at is highest in the morning and steadily declines as the day wears on.</blockquote><p>Very useful</p><blockquote>If you're dreading something you know you need to do, commit to do it for just 10 minutes and then decide whether to continue.</blockquote><p>About pre-commitment</p><blockquote>Taking action now to strengthen your decision to a behaviour and ward off any underhanded attempts at self-sabotage</blockquote><p>Not so sure on this</p><blockquote>We are the average of the five people we spend the most time with.</blockquote><p>I'm clearly not the average at all. The next one is not a bad idea.</p><blockquote>Join forces with at least one person who's on the same path as you and making progress</blockquote><h2 id="fitness-goals">Fitness goals</h2><blockquote>Brainstorm your reasons for getting in shape and write them down until you feel pumped up and ready to get into action.</blockquote><ol><li>By being in shape I can much more easily find the type of sexual partner I find attractive.</li><li>I want to feel sexy when I look at myself in the mirror.</li><li>I want to look younger and I know I do when I have less body fat (BF).</li><li>With less BF I'll have less hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) problems.</li><li>I would love to be able to run 1 km in 4 minutes. Even if it's just one.</li><li>Not worrying about my body, would be like lifting a giant rock from my shoulders.</li></ol><h2 id="about-pre-and-post-workout-meals">About pre and post-workout meals</h2><p>Basically it says you should eat protein before, after working out and before going to sleep.</p><p>Preworkout you should eat carbs too.</p><p>Eating protein after working out reverses the protein breakdown rates.</p><h2 id="meal-planning">Meal planning</h2><p>I would add to meal planning calculating your macros, deciding how many foods per day you want to do and then divide the totals to get how many of each you need per food. Then you can prepare meals that amount to those exact grams of macros.</p><blockquote>All decisions you make every day, big and small bring you closer to that failing point (decision fatigue) ... meal planning is the easiest way to reclaim that mental and emotional energy.</blockquote><p>Type of foods</p><blockquote>Should consist of relatively unprocessed foods</blockquote><p>The steps</p><blockquote>The first step is to make a list of your preferred sources for protein, fats and carbs.</blockquote><p>I'm doing that in the<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Xeamc8OTBD0AiHEXzbhozHG46uJzExPtdxVuzSbsRg/edit#gid=531968003"> excel spreadsheet</a> where I keep everything.</p><blockquote>Step 2: familiarise yourself with the nutritional facts of the food you've chosen.</blockquote><p>Notice that on a second search I should add what's saturated in fat on that list.</p><p>It might be easier to do an online shopping.</p><p>The final steps</p><blockquote>3. Set first your pre &amp; post workout meals; 4. add your primary source of protein to the rest of your meals; 5. add your fruit and veg; 6. add additional carbs (including beverages); 7. tweak protein intake as needed (as more carb meal have protein); 8. add additional fat as needed.</blockquote><p>So that's the meal planning method.</p><blockquote>Saturated fat shouldn't be more than 10% of your total calories.</blockquote><p>Important</p><blockquote>When cutting don't include any caloric beverages as they don't satiate.</blockquote><h2 id="workouts">Workouts</h2><blockquote>most of your hard sets are going to entail doing at least four reps but not more than six...research shows that is highly effective for gaining muscle and strength.</blockquote><p>So now I do 3 sets of 4 to 6 hard reps.</p><blockquote>Except in a few exercise like dumbell side and rear raise (shoulders), cable fly (chest) and cable crunch (abs)</blockquote><p>Notice this exercise, but notice they are examples, there could be more. I know for a fact he means doing 8 to 10 reps on those later.</p><blockquote>Perform 9 to 15 hard sets (that means exercises of 3 sets each).</blockquote><p>About rest and this is hard. Especially when the gym is busy.</p><blockquote>Rest 2 to 4 minutes between hard sets.</blockquote><blockquote>Periodically take 5 to 7 days off weighlifting.</blockquote><p>More on that above later.</p><blockquote>Follow the traditional 1-1-1 tempo. Doing slower is a waste of time, the slower you go, the less reps you can do.</blockquote><p>Deload weeks</p><blockquote>Plan a deload week every 8 to 10 weeks.</blockquote><p>Do deload weeks when your progress stalls.</p><blockquote>Be a stickler of good form.</blockquote><p>Should consider this when doing quadriceps.</p><h2 id="about-hiit">About HIIT</h2><blockquote>Moving fast enough that your breathing becomes laboured ...and then you need to hold that speed for a period of time.</blockquote><p>About ratios</p><blockquote>Start with a 1:2 ratio. 1 minute of hard work = 2 of steady work. When your intensity improves move toward a 1:1 ratio.</blockquote><p>Duration</p><blockquote>20 to 25 minutes of intervals.</blockquote><h2 id="about-walking">About walking</h2><blockquote>Loses fat too, doesn't impact muscle gain, the least stressful way to augment weight loss.</blockquote><p>Duration</p><blockquote>Should do it for several hours per week.</blockquote><p>As a combination</p><blockquote>One to three 25 minutes HIIT session per week &amp; two two three 30 to 45 minutes walks per week</blockquote><h2 id="supplements">Supplements</h2><p>About synephrine</p><blockquote>Synephrine blocks the alpha-receptors on fat cells, which means it can speed up stubborn fat loss.</blockquote><p>About creatine</p><blockquote>Creatine also enhances muscle growth by increasing the amount of water in muscle cells</blockquote><h2 id="cutting-and-lean-bulking-phases">Cutting and lean bulking phases.</h2><blockquote>Start with cutting if you're above 15% body fat, and stop at 10%. Stop bulking when you're back at 15%.</blockquote><p>Duration</p><blockquote>Cuts might last 10 to 14 weeks and lean bulks 12 to 16 weeks.</blockquote><h3 id="tips-when-cutting">Tips when cutting</h3><p>Sleeping</p><blockquote>The amount people sleep has a marked effect on weight loss.</blockquote><p>Effective density</p><blockquote>Don't drink calories when cutting (the opposite is also true).</blockquote><p>Water</p><blockquote>Drink plenty of water, water satiates.</blockquote><h3 id="tips-when-lean-bulking">Tips when lean bulking</h3><p>Effective density</p><blockquote>Drink your calories</blockquote><p>Planning</p><blockquote>Stick to a plan or you'll under eat.</blockquote><p>Cardio</p><blockquote>Keep cardio to a minimum.</blockquote><h2 id="periodization">Periodization</h2><blockquote>Eight weeks of hard ...</blockquote><p>So basically change a few exercises every 8 weeks. Like different angles of each muscle.</p><blockquote>Start with your hardest compound exercises and finish with your easier isolation exercises.</blockquote><p>The formula:</p><blockquote>2 to 3 major muscle groups, warm up set as needed, 4 to 6 hard reps, 9 to 15 hard sets per workout, 2 to 4 minutes of rest between workouts.</blockquote><p>Exercises with asterisk (so 8-10 reps)</p><blockquote>Calf raise, dumbbell side lateral raise, lying leg curl, seated calf raise.</blockquote><p>That's basically calves and shoulders, but reading later he means also abs.</p><blockquote>For deloading perform every exercise in 2 sets of 3 reps with the last hard-set weight.</blockquote><p>Holidays</p><blockquote>Make deloading coincide with holidays.</blockquote><h2 id="taking-creatine">Taking creatine</h2><p>Dosage</p><blockquote>studies have shown that 5 grams per day is optimal</blockquote><p>Starting out</p><blockquote>When you start you can benefit more from taking 20 grams per day for the first 5 to 7 days and see benefits sooner.</blockquote><p>Ideal time to take it.</p><blockquote>Studies have shown that taking creatine after a workout is slightly more effective for increasing strength and muscle gain than taking it before.</blockquote><p>About fat burners when lean bulking</p><blockquote>it'll simply mean you'll eat more to maintain a calorie surplus. So don't do it.</blockquote><p>About protein intake</p><blockquote>Don't get more than 30% of your protein intake from <strong>powders .</strong></blockquote><p>Synephrine</p><blockquote>Effective dosage of synephrine are 25 to 50 mgs per day and can be taken anywhere from one to three times daily.</blockquote></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article
