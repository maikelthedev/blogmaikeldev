I'm drinking more water and more protein.<br>I'm wondering whether  it is mandatory I add cardio. I don't want those 6kgs of fat in my body. I remember I ate a lot of nuts so that might be part of the issue. Exercising I'm sure it is not the issue.</p><p>I don't think the numbers are accurate since I've got the exact same measure of belly circumference (88cms) after having eaten. I think the scale measures differently when I started drinking more water. There's no chance I've lost muscle and added fat when I see myself visibly smaller in the mirror.</p><p>It might be that the fact my intestines are full (I'm drinking more protein more often) is the reason the scale is thinking I'm fatter.</p><p>Maybe I should try dry fasting. Because of <a href="https://www.marksdailyapple.com/guide-to-dry-fasting/">this</a></p><blockquote>The drop in waist circumference was particularly large—about eight centimeters by day five</blockquote><p>There's even a study that correlates with the results <a href="https://www.karger.com/article/FullText/505201">here</a></p><p>So I'm going to try to do a 5-day dry fast to see if it has any effect on my waist circumference. I'm using an app to track it. They key would be to entertain myself enough to follow it through.</p><h3 id="week-2-10th-of-may">Week 2: 10th of May.</h3><p>I've lost 3 cms of belly circumference (85cms now) which is a decent improvement. I failed at doing 5 days of dry fasting but managed to do it twice, once 24 full hours, the second 20 full hours. It worked quite nicely.</p><p>Apparently I've lost 500 grams of belly fat and now I'm on 5.5 kgs. Body fat has also lowered to 19.5% and it's starting to get rare to see it above 20%.</p><p>Throughout the week muscle mass has been first really low then getting higher until reaching 55.6 kgs. It's like if I lost some while on the dry fasting days and quickly recovered them on the protein up days.</p><p>Btw, that's what I ended up doing, body recomposition alternating fasting with getting more protein, using the pain of my body as an indicator of when I should add protein. Today I'm painless so I'm going for a 24 hour fast.</p><p>I think this week I've done fine and I should keep up until I figure a better way. The only change I'm introducing this week is trying egg protein instead of whey protein because I think the whey protein is messing up with my armpits.</p><h3 id="week-3-17th-of-may-2021">Week 3: 17th of May (2021).</h3><p>I could barely try anything this week because I was moving flats. Funnily enough I managed to keep going down by just controlling my meals and doing the home workout routine.</p><p>I'm 71.5 kgs and 18.9% body fat. Progress! Now where I fucked it up is in waist circumference but that's out of yesterday being a messy day probably.</p><p>What is interesting is where I was ages ago when I was 68kgs, according to some pictures I found of bath scales I was around 15% body fat. From nowadays point of view I think I was too skinny. That means I've got to be VERY careful with how I lose weight. Also it seems I was only 74 cms belly circumference. So there's a long way to go. I wonder whether to do again dry fasting. It's not easy while exercising.</p><h2 id="week-of-2nd-of-august-2021">Week of 2nd of August 2021.</h2><p>I'm in Seville, so change of routine. I was really sick two weeks ago and thanks to that I dropped some kilos and loads of body fat. I'm becoming more accustomed to the heat in consequence.</p><p>So I'm around 16.8% body fat and around 68 kgs, I also am 82 centimetres. This last figure is the one I'm paying the most attention to.</p><h2 id="stage-2">Stage 2</h2><p>Stuff is mainly working, went from 21% to 16% body fat. The goal here is 13% body fat  while remaining between 68 to 70 kgs.</p><p>I feel stronger, tighter, yet my belly is the weakest point, that's the only part where loose flesh is felt.</p><h3 id="stuff-ive-learnt">Stuff I've learnt</h3><ul><li>Nuts are bad to lose weight.</li><li>Coffee and fasting are a bad combination.</li><li>Dry fasting is what works best at reducing belly circumference.</li><li>Whey protein is bad for me.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/what-one-lifter-learned-from-not-eating-for-60-hours.html"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"> </div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"> </div><p> </p></a></figure></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on Monday, 26 June 2023</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.maikel.dev%2Fapplying-tdd-to-body-perfection.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Facebook"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://blog.maikel.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://wa.me/?text=Applying%20TDD%20to%20body%20perfection https%3A%2F%2Fblog.maikel.dev%2Fapplying-tdd-to-body-perfection.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Share with WhatsApp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://blog.maikel.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.maikel.dev%2Fapplying-tdd-to-body-perfection.html" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://blog.maikel.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://blog.maikel.dev/authors/maikel/" title="Maikel">Maikel</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://blog.maikel.dev/goals-and-whys.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Goals and whys</h5></div><img src="https://blog.maikel.dev/media/posts/5/responsive/ronnie-overgoor-EdKCckXXRCI-unsplash1-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1280" width="1920"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Follow us</h3><div class="follow"><a href="https://fedi.maikel.dev/@maikel" class="twitter" aria-label="Twitter"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://blog.maikel.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> Twitter </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maikelthedev/" class="linkedin" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://blog.maikel.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> LinkedIn</a></div></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://blog.maikel.dev/tags/dieting/">dieting</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li><li><a href="https://blog.maikel.dev/tags/introductions/">introductions</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://blog.maikel.dev/">Maikel&#x27;s Blog</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__follow"><a href="https://fedi.maikel.dev/@maikel" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.maikel.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maikelthedev/" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.maikel.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Maikel OÜ</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
