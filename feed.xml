                <h2 id="relationship-with-the-fediverse">Relationship with the fediverse</h2>
<p>I normally think a lot about the way I interact with the #fediverse thinking whether I am making the most of it or becoming just part of the entertainment. I think it needs to be a 50/50 relationship. You must supply positive interaction while getting the same back. </p>
<p>And I think I need to cut down on my tooting, because otherwise I’m just in the same place I was when I used Facebook. Also I need more real-life contact with people and this is kind of becoming too…hmm….how do I put it: <strong>addictive</strong></p>
<p>And in a really bad way. </p>
<p>The transition is really slow, but slowly you notice how you either:
a) slowly shift toward writing what others find interesting. 
b) suddenly having an awarenes of “a)” happening and bluntly doing the opposite. </p>
<p>In either case you feel how your sense of “self” starts to fade, and to recover that selfness you need to detox a little. So I might start doing that. </p>
<p><strong>HOW?</strong> Focusing on less worrying and more on doing, with takes me to the next subject:</p>
<h2 id="is-worrying-a-useful-feelingaction">Is worrying a useful feeling/action?</h2>
<p>This morning I took a long detour from the gym back home, I really needed some fresh air and quality me-time. Sometimes the best way to get in contact with yourself is to escape to nature. That doesn’t abound in Seville except in the riverside, both of them. </p>
<p>And in the process I started thinking, one was about my company of which I’ll talk on the next subject, the other was how much time do I waste worrying and whether I achieve anything meaningful by worrying, at all or is one of those useless feelings. </p>
<p>I don’t think worrying achieves anything, in fact I’m starting to believe it is a <strong>toxic</strong> action. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>It gives you a fake sense of “doing” something, when you actually aren’t. </li>
<li>In terms of actions, the only thing it does is to rephrase the problem you have again in again in your head without actually giving you any answers. Wouldn’t it be quicker to write them down in a notepad, than repeating the same action every day?</li>
<li>The frustration of not having any immediate answers to any of the questions that feed the worrying phase, only paralyse you, damage your self-esteem the more you repeat the same question over a number of days, leads you to nowhere, solves nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>But what would I do instead. I can’t think of those questions without worrying, is not as if one could live a worry free life. </p>
<p>These are complex questions of which I won’t get any answer quickly. I just think I should cut on the worrying and spend more time doing. If those questions don’t have an answer today, maybe let them settle for a bit on their own while I actually do something useful with the time I would have spent otherwise doing worrying, meaning nothing. </p>
<p>So what to do instead? How about a course on Elixir, how about more time creating meaningful processes for my company? This leads me to the next subject:</p>
<h2 id="what-is-maikel-oüs-unique-selling-point-usp">What is Maikel OÜ’s Unique-Selling Point (USP)</h2>
<p><em>Note: assume whenever you see Maikel with OÜ I mean the company, <strong>not me</strong>. OÜ is Estonian for LTD, it’s the legal full name of the company Maikel Limited = Maikel OÜ. I registered the company in Estonian for the simpified bureacracy</em>*</p>
<p>My other thought while on my morning escape. The point is <strong>time</strong>, Maikel OÜ is in the business of trading time. What do I mean?</p>
<p>My company is a funnel, a closed one. I trade on the effiency of the use of time. Companies pay me to do something for them they don’t have the time, patience, to do, for <strong>much less</strong> than will cost them in either time, money or both to be done by them. My skillset and ability to increase it quickly, is their efficiency. This in terms translates in money that translates the other way, hence, the closed loop, in time I get to spend not worrying about how do I feed myself, but reading books, doing courses, increasing my skillset, increasing <strong>the efficiency at which I can produce that time they save</strong>. Doing the courses, increasing my skillset is what makes me happy, this is why I’m into IT, because what makes me happy does actually save others time, headaches <strong>and money</strong>. </p>
<p>I’m going to have to learn Minio inside out (not necessarily but I know I will) to create a simple automation of development of a 3-node cluster and I’m eager to begin not because of the money I’ll earn (which is laughable and buys me very little time) but because of the pleasure I know I’ll derive from the learning of this and the extra pleasure I know I will get from knowing doing something I love will solve someone else’s problem. </p>
<p>That’s my selling point. </p>
<p>Which means I’ll never be a big company. Maikel OÜ will never expand. In the far future it might have someone doing secretarial bits, so I can get rid of Xolo, and that person might be in charge of bring business in, but I won’t grow, I will always be a small business since my dedication is on both time saved for my clients and time obtained for my learning. I might and surely will collaborate with others, that’s the whole idea of getting work through referrals (which is on itself not easy, you <strong>must be good</strong> to get those referrals), I don’t want to grow. </p>
<p>I want my clients to grow. </p>
<p>I want them to think of me for their problems while they grow. </p>
<p>I want to build business <strong>loyalty</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="company-has-now-eu-vat-id">Company has now EU Vat ID</h2>
<p>I don’t have to apply for EU Vat ID because as per Estonian law, I don’t have to pay VAT until I reach 40 thousand euros per year. That means all my invoices are vatless. 
But that doesn’t mean I can’t apply earlier. It is not illegal to have VAT ID before I need it. It is only Xolo, my accountants, that prefer we don’t as that means more paperwork for them. For me it makes no difference since it’s included in what I pay them every month. </p>
<p>I was about to lose some work due to not having a VAT ID so I applied for it and now in theory Maikel OÜ has VAT ID EE102644089</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mkl.lol/files/291d1c4d-a75b-4386-8627-b142217dfe09" alt="Vat ID"  data-is-external-image="true"></figure> </p>
<p>And I say in theory because that number seems to not have propagated yet, I guess it might take a couple of days because when I search it in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/#/vat-validation">this database</a> it still shows as non-valid. </p>
<h3 id="update">Update:</h3>
<p>Got a message form Kadri from xolo, the VAT ID number is valid from next Wednesday (the 15th). </p>
<h2 id="back-in-paypal">Back in Paypal</h2>
<p>I’m back in Paypal with the account <a href="https://paypal.me/maikelthedev">@maikelthedev</a> . I don’t like Paypal at all for company payments but for personal donations is not that bad. </p>
<p>I’m adding it to the website donations page but I don’t know how quick they are at letting me withdraw the funds. It’s <a href="https://maikel.dev/donations">done now</a> donating with PayPal is now an option. </p>
<h2 id="developing-a-contract-writing-workflow">Developing a contract-writing workflow</h2>
<p>I should stop second-guessing myself because after googling “contract software” and reading….</p>
<ul>
<li>this <a href="https://www.pandadoc.com/blog/best-contract-management-software/">https://www.pandadoc.com/blog/best-contract-management-software/</a></li>
<li>this <a href="https://www.makeitfuture.com/automation/contract-generation">https://www.makeitfuture.com/automation/contract-generation</a></li>
<li>and this <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-apps-to-create-contract-proposal/">https://www.makeuseof.com/best-apps-to-create-contract-proposal/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>…what I ultimately learnt is that I already had the best eSigning tool for the job. Hellosign or now called Dropbox Sign. </p>
<p>So I’ve created a contract model based on this one and the one of Survation in Word document. All I have to do is to edit the clauses. That document is on my Netxdrive. </p>
<p>So the best tool is actually LibreOffice. Well process done. In the future I’d like to have this all automated on my website. </p>
<p>This is all for today. </p>

                <p>This is about <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/tailwind-from-scratch">this course</a> I’m learning it so that I can use it on my website. </p>
<p>The point of the course is, as any course (but he explicitely says it) you don’t have to go to the documentation for anything at all. This course is 12 hours long and as usual I’m playing it at 2x speed. </p>
<p>I’m doing this course to basically be as profficient in Tailwind as I am already in Bootstrap. </p>
<h2 id="section-1-introduction">Section 1: Introduction</h2>
<p>I could need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content for the middle seciton of my site. </li>
<li>Login modal / Sign Up Modal</li>
<li>Services page, not sure if purchasable straight from there or not. </li>
<li>Frequently assk questions (his last project) is similar to what I want. With the FAQ.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-2-tailwind-fundatmentals---part-1">Section 2: Tailwind Fundatmentals - Part 1</h2>
<h4 id="whats-that-utility-first-thing">What’s that “Utility First” thing</h4>
<p>Basically you choose all the CSS in the classes but Tailwind has stuff that already builts creating things from scratch and typing CSS, I see no different between this an Bootstrap. </p>
<p>The difference between it and Bootstrap is the customisation. </p>
<h4 id="colours">Colours</h4>
<p>You can use classes</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">bg-cyan-500
outline-cyan-500
text-red-500
border-red-500
accent-red-500
shadow-red-500
</code></pre>
<p>The initial word is what you want to apply the colour, the middle is the colour name, the last is from 0 (clear) to 1000 (completely black). </p>
<h4 id="spacing">Spacing</h4>
<p>You can add a file to specify what the default sizes are, but they are all already <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design">here</a>, just learn it, it is pretty similar to Boostrap there. </p>
<p>Here you can target speficic size by using space-y-4 (space vertical of 4) or margin with m, padding with p. </p>
<h4 id="typography">Typography</h4>
<p>There are 3 defaults and obviously you can use your own font, use tailwind.config.js to do that. You have 3, your sans, serif and mono but you can change those 3 to whatever you want. </p>
<p>Alignment is pretty easy: text-right, text-center, text-left. </p>
<p>Underline comes with: decoration-doble (two underlines), decoiration-dotted, even decoration-wavy. </p>
<h4 id="layout--position">Layout &amp; Position</h4>
<p>You can make fun stuff like absolute right within a parent container with “absolute bottom-0 right-0 bg-yellow-100”</p>
<p>intset is one interesting class. More <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/top-right-bottom-left">here</a></p>
<h4 id="backgrounds--shadows">Backgrounds &amp; Shadows</h4>
<p>You can use shadow-lg, shadow-xl, for the border. 
For the inside, you can use shadow-inner or even shadow-blue for cololurs. </p>
<p>This might make snese for the logo. </p>
<h2 id="section-3-tailwind-fundamentals---part-2">Section 3: Tailwind Fundamentals - part 2</h2>
<h4 id="interactivity">Interactivity</h4>
<p>You can add “hover:whatever” and describe the change or “focus:” or “active:”. </p>
<p>You use group when you want multiple elements to change at the same time, you add group class to the parent and to the children “group-hover:whatever” for example. </p>
<h4 id="colunns-and-gaps">Colunns and gaps</h4>
<p> You can put images in coluns with “column-4” (divide screen in 4 columns and) and gap you can have it or not with “gap-0” on the parent. </p>
<h4 id="flexbox">Flexbox</h4>
<p>Flex creates it, flex-col puts them in columns, md:flex-row would put it in a row as you make the screen bigger. </p>
<p>flex-wrap drops them down when full in the flexbox. </p>
<p>It does make sense to add bg-blue-100 on each element while you’re tinkering with their location and size. </p>
<h4 id="grid">Grid</h4>
<p>Use the grid class on the parent, then grid-cols-2 or whatever, and gap, depending on what you want, is similar to the way you use flexbox. </p>
<p>Using col-span-2 etc I can imagine this could be useful for a dashboard. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do tend to use X more. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He repeats again and again, but do not explain why. This course is trash. </p>
<h4 id="transition">Transition</h4>
<p>Add transition-colours with duration-1000 for 1 second.  You describe the change with hover and it goes slowly from one colour (the one it has) to the one you set in hover. </p>
<h4 id="animation">Animation</h4>
<p>You could use it for progress spinners: animate-spin</p>
<h4 id="dark-mode">Dark Mode</h4>
<p>If your browser or OS is in dark mode you can configure the classes to have a dark mode with “dark:”</p>
<h2 id="section-4-a-better-development-environment">Section 4: A better development environment</h2>
<p>To create a tailwind project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init // creates the tailiwind.config.js file
</code></pre>
<p>Create an input.css file and add the 4 directives that are needed. </p>
<p>All instructions are <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation">here</a> so there’s no reason to describe them here.</p>
<h3 id="directives--functions">Directives &amp; Functions</h3>
<p>You can use this to avoid repeating again and again the same classes, for example you can make all of the h1 tags to be the same so you odn’t have to redefine them on your code. Adding less classes when you code. </p>
<h2 id="section-5-tailwind-css-mini-projects">Section 5: TailWind CSS Mini-Projects</h2>
<h4 id="order">Order</h4>
<p>Start with padding, then alignment, then size, then adapt to other screens, then transofrmations (hover, focus, active…etc). </p>
<p>It’s good practice to start mobile first. </p>
<h4 id="text-effects">Text-effects</h4>
<p>Use line-through to get it scratched out and inline-block when you want it to have a background that only covers the text. </p>
<h2 id="section-6-project-1---clipboard-website">Section 6: Project 1 - Clipboard website</h2>
<p>From here you could take the Hero section configuration. 
The goal is really to create stuff in tailwind.config.js once you have a clear layout so you don’t have to repeat yourself afterwards and just focus on the content. </p>
<h2 id="section-7891011">Section 7,8,9,10,11:</h2>
<p>Nevermind this course is bullshit. I’ve requested a refund to Udemy because he’s basically explaining nothing. </p>
<h1 id="tailwind-documentation-cheat-sheet">Tailwind Documentation cheat-sheet</h1>
<p>Since the course was useless, I’m going to go through the docs quicker and move on. </p>

                <p>I’m learning NextJS by doing <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide">this course</a> by my favourite Udemy tutor Maximilian. </p>
<p>I’m going to divide this notes in sections same as the course and I’m going to use </p>
<h2 id="reasons-im-learning-it">Reasons I’m learning it</h2>
<ul>
<li>I want to design <a href="http://www.maikel.dev">www.maikel.dev</a> using it.</li>
<li>I want to refresh my knowledge of React since it has been a while since the last time I used it.</li>
<li>I want server-side rendering. I’ve seen how hideously slow SPA are on regularly powered computers. </li>
<li>I think React has far more future than Angular will ever have. </li>
<li>I ‘d like to do the Fedigrindr app using this too.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-1-getting-started">Section 1: Getting started</h2>
<p>The simplest way to create an app is to use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npx create-next-app
</code></pre>
<p>on the shell console. </p>
<p>Shortcut to format document: Ctlr+Shift-i </p>
<p>A NextJS app seems to be a monolitic node app. </p>
<h3 id="why-not-choose-use-app-router">Why not choose use App Router?</h3>
<p>Because otherwise you create a different folder structure instead of the pages. </p>
<h2 id="section-2-react-refresher">Section 2: React Refresher</h2>
<p>ReactJS is used (same as Angular) to make pages reactive, seem instant. Also is all about components. Webs divided in smaller parts. </p>
<p>Also to create a basic skeleton of a React app. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npx create-react-app
</code></pre>
<p>useState is a bit confusing. </p>
<p>Default router he uses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install --save react-router-dom@5
</code></pre>
<p>All the routing thing is boring since I know already what this all is. The only thing I neede to remember is that to pass properties you just pass them in props and every React object has props, e.g.:</p>
<h4 id="how-to-pass-properties-to-children">How to pass properties to children</h4>
<p>This can also be used to pass actions to the parents. </p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">// Some parent object
return (
    &lt;div&gt;
       &lt;ChildComponent someText=&quot;hello&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
)

// Some child component becomes:
function ChildComponent(props) { //Props need to be defined here otherwise can&#39;t be accessed. 

return (
   &lt;div&gt;
             &lt;h1&gt;{props.someText}&lt;/h1&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
     )
     
}
</code></pre>
<p>Don’t use normla links as they’ll be sent to the server which is redundant. Use “LInk” instead. </p>
<h4 id="render-a-list-of-jsx-elements">Render a list of JSX elements</h4>
<p>Note that each element of a list must have an (unique) ID added as the key prop.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">&lt;h1&gt;Some list&lt;/h1&gt;
{DUMMY_DATA.map((single) =&gt; {
    return &lt;SomeChildComponent key={single.id} title={single.title}} /&gt;
})}
</code></pre>
<p>I need to remember change this Harvest task to NextJS-course I want to know exaclty how much time I’ve invested on this by the end of it. </p>
<h4 id="passing-content-to-another-component">Passing content to another component</h4>
<p>Use props.children</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">&lt;Example&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Something else&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/Example&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Won’t render unless you pass props.children such as inside the Example component</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">return (
    &lt;div&gt;
        {props.children
    &lt;/div&gt;
)
</code></pre>
<p>Now whatever content was after the tag will be rendered too inside. That’s how you use Wrapper components (e.g.: Card). </p>
<h4 id="prevent-form-submission">Prevent form submission.</h4>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">
function submitHandler(event) { // You need event here
  event.preventDefault() // this is what actually prevents the form submission. 
    }

return (
&lt;form onSubmit={submitHandler}&gt; ....thje form content &lt;/form&gt;
)
</code></pre>
<h4 id="useref-to-use-the-details-of-a-form">UseRef to use the details of a form</h4>
<p>This is a ref prop that is used to get an element through a referent object, example. </p>

<h4 id="reminder-how-to-send-http-request">Reminder, how to send HTTP request.</h4>
<p>Lots of packages, for this as usual. fetch() is the one built in. Example for POST request.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">fetch(
    &#39;SOMEURL&#39;, 
    {
        method: &quot;POST&quot;,
        body: theData // Use JSON.stringify if needed
        headers: 
            {
            &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json
            }
    }
)
</code></pre>
<p>You could use Redis here for simplicity while testing</p>
<h4 id="using-usehistory-to-navigate">Using useHistory to navigate</h4>
<p>import it from the router. </p>
<p>then add </p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const history = useHistory() // to the function 

//Imagine you have a fetch and want to trigger going somewhere

fetch(DOSOMETHING).then(
    history.replace(&#39;/somerelativepath&#39;);
)
</code></pre>
<h4 id="reminder-on-how-to-fetch-data">Reminder on how to fetch data</h4>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">fetch(&#39;someURL&#39;).then(response =&gt; {
        return response.json() // To convert it to JSON
    }).then(data =&gt; {
        doSomethingWith(data)
    });
</code></pre>
<p>Very probably other libraries don’t require to convert to manually to json as a step. </p>
<h4 id="using-usestate-for-loading">Using useState for loading</h4>
<p>Use state to change what’s visible on the screen while loading. Beware a fetch should have a useEffect to avoid running for all eternity. </p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import {useState] from &quot;react&quot;

const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

// Then on the fetch function change it to call setIsLoading(false)
</code></pre>
<h4 id="using-useeffect-to-avoid-runnning-loops">Using useEffect to avoid runnning loops</h4>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">useEffect(() =&gt; {
            fetch(....)
        }, 
        [isLoading ] // Check the values on this array before executing the rest of the effect (the fetch), so in this case isLoading won&#39;t execute again. In this case isLoading shouldn&#39;t be there, and by being empty it&#39;ll only run once. 
        );
</code></pre>
<h4 id="react-context">React Context</h4>
<p>Common convention is to set up a Store folder. Alternatives to RC is Redux. </p>
<p>To create a context</p>
<pre><code>import {createContext, useState} from &quot;react&quot;;

const YourContext = createContext({
    users:  [ ],
    totalUsers: 0
});
// You also need a provider of that context
function YourContextProivider(props) {
// Here you can manage state same as in any other React component. 
    const [users, setUsers] = useState([ ]);
    
    const context = {
        users: users,
        titalUserS: users.length
    };
    
    return (
    &lt;YourContext.Provider value={context}&gt;
        {props.children}
    &lt;/YourContext.Provider&gt;
    )
</code></pre>
<p>I think it’s a singleton. You could save this as yourcontext-context.js in the store folder. 
The hook to access that one would be useContext</p>
<h4 id="how-to-use-usecontext">How to use useContext</h4>
<p>Well, same as useState, etc. </p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import {UserContext} from  from &quot;whervever&quot;
const userContext = useContext(UserContext);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="section-3-pages--file-based-routing">Section 3: Pages &amp; File-based routing</h2>
<p>With file-based routing you simply create a file to route to it, inside the pages folder. If you want to create a folder the main one should be called index.js and all others will be subpages of that main one (whose name is the folder name).</p>
<p>For stuff that’s dinamic use folders and filenames with [id] or [client]</p>
<p>You could also use […slug] for pages that are of a blog (slug can be anything) or any Catch-all routes</p>
<h4 id="link-advantages">Link advantages</h4>
<p>By using link it prefetches anything from the link as soon as you hoover it. </p>
<h4 id="navigate-programatically">Navigate programatically</h4>
<p>Use router.push(‘theroute’) to go and be able to go back
Use router.replace(‘theroute’) to go but without being able to go back. </p>
<h4 id="custom-made-404-page">Custom made 404 page.</h4>
<p>Just make a 404.js page on the pages folder, give it whatever name you want and it is what will be shown.</p>
<p>I wonder how long until he explains componentisation so I can design a navigation menu. So far it seems as if every page is its own page. </p>
<h2 id="section-4-working-with-file-based-routing">Section 4: Working with file-based routing</h2>
<p>If you hae two pages in the same folder and one of them is [eventId] and the other is […slug] the first one will only be picked up as far as the user types the URL with just 1 varaialble, more than one will pick up the second page.</p>
<p>Create a foldr called components to store all the bits and pieces normal of Angular/React. You can call it whatever you want but that way won’t interfere with file-based pages. </p>
<p>To use eventId on the example about</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const router = useRouter();
const eventId = router.query.eventId;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="wrapping-it-all-in-a-layout-with-a-header-and-footer">Wrapping it all in a Layout with a header and footer.</h4>
<p>Modify _app.js to be wrapped in a Layout wrapper component that has props.children on it. </p>
<p>I’m not exactly getting what a Fragment is. Ok I get it now thanks to <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment">this</a></p>
<h2 id="section-5-page-pre-rendering-and-data-fetching">Section 5: Page Pre-Rendering and Data Fetching</h2>
<p>This is about SSR (server-side rendering) which is the key feature of NextJs. </p>
<p>NextJS have to types of pre-rendering, static generation and SSR on the fly. </p>
<h4 id="using-getstaticprops">Using getStaticProps()</h4>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">export async function getStaticProps(context) {}
</code></pre>
<p>The function must be written exactly like that and it’ll only execute on the server, never on the client, in fact it’ll be hidden from the client. There’s no window object. You can put DB code there for example. Or read from a filesystem file (useful for markdown or JSON for example). Use the FS module with async/await. </p>
<p><a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#promise-example">https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#promise-example</a></p>
<p>It should return {props: whateverObject}</p>
<p>You can tell that function to work again on </p>
<p>You can say it with the props that you return, example</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">return {
        props: someObject, 
        revalidate: 10 // This would be th enumber of seconds to revalidate. 
        }
</code></pre>
<p>That’s incremental static regeneration. </p>
<h4 id="using-redirect">Using redirect.</h4>
<p>It’s another key inside getStaticProps where you coudl specify where to send the user in case the page didn’t load or the access to the DB didn’t work for any reason. </p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">return {
    redirect: &#39;/404-nodata
    }
</code></pre>
<h4 id="extracting-context-for-ssr">Extracting context for SSR.</h4>
<p>Instead of route.query.eventId (just recycling the example above, you’d use inside the getStaticProps this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">export async function getStaticProps(context) {
    const { params } = context;
    const eventId = params.eventId;
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="using-getstaticpath">Using getStaticPath()</h4>
<p>Default behavior for dynamic pages is not to generate them, such as [eventId]</p>
<pre><code>export async function getStaticPaths() {
    return {
        paths: [
                {params: {eventId: &quot;1&quot;} }
                {params: {eventId: &quot;2&quot;} }
                {params: {eventId: &quot;3&quot;} }
        ],
        fallback: false
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="using-fallback-true">Using fallback: true</h4>
<p>Using fallback set to true stuff is generated before when first visited. Imagine one as before but with eventId:4. When using this you should put a loading page or something because nothing will be created no the first visit yet. </p>
<h4 id="not-found">Not found</h4>
<p>You can return {notFound: true} to send the user to a 404 Not found page in the absence of a product with the ID the user request for example. </p>
<h4 id="using-getserversideprops">Using getServerSideProps()</h4>
<p>This one is never statically pre-generated. You get access to params, req and res. Yoo cannot use it with getStaticProps because it wouldn’t make any sense. </p>
<pre><code>export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
const {params, req, res} = context
returns { props: thePropsObject} 
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="whats-useswr-hook">What’s useSWR hook.</h4>
<p>Is one to use instead of useEffect() to get data from the client side. Just check the docs. </p>
<h2 id="section-6-project-time-page-pre-rendering--data-fetching">Section 6: Project Time: Page Pre-rendering &amp; Data Fetching</h2>
<p>If you set fallback to blocking on any of the functions of the previous section nothing will be generated until the generation of the data has finished. </p>
<h2 id="section-7-optimizing-nextjs-apps">Section 7: Optimizing NextJS Apps</h2>
<h4 id="the-head-component">THe head component.</h4>
<p>It is na import from NetxJS. It works to add stuff between Head tags. You could use it with the _app.js file to have a generic head for all pages. </p>
<p>If you use the same Head thing in different places with the same values, it takes the later one. </p>
<h4 id="the-_documentjs-file">The _document.js file</h4>
<p>I don’t think you’ll ever need this one but if you do check direclty <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/25145892#overview">this</a> video. It is useful if you want to change the HTML document itself. </p>
<h4 id="optmising-images">Optmising images</h4>
<p>This is interesting. Using the Image component NextJS will optimise on the fly the image. Width and Height are mandatory when using this one. </p>
<h2 id="section-8-adding-backend-code-with-api-routes-fullstack-react">Section 8: Adding Backend Code with API Routes (Fullstack React)</h2>
<p>The code inside “api” won’t ever go to the client. </p>
<h4 id="you-must-use-the-api-folder">You must use the API folder</h4>
<p>NextJS requires that if you use an API it has the folder named “api”. 
It’s very similar to vanilla express but also uses the pages file-based format. So if you want a users api endpoint you just create a users.js file inside “api” folder and inside, similar as express:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function handler(req, res) {
    res.status(200
        .json({status: &quot;ok&quot;})
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="communication-front-end-backend">Communication front-end backend</h4>
<p>If you’re going to use getStaticProps from the frontend then you shouldn’t use fetch since it’s all in your project. Instead you should DRY and make the code you have in your API a function that can be accessed from getStaticProps()</p>
<h2 id="section-9-project-time-api-routes">Section 9: Project Time: API Routes</h2>
<p>Not much on this section that I need to write down….Talks a lot about Mongo DB which I know inside out since I used it to model the data of the Survation Panel. </p>
<h2 id="section-10-working-with-app-wide-state-react-context">Section 10: Working with App-wide State (React Context)</h2>
<p>Nothing special here, it is the same as ContextProviders before…. .</p>
<h2 id="section-11-complete-app-example-build-a-full-blog-a-to-z">Section 11: Complete App Example: Build a Full Blog A to Z</h2>
<p>The only bit that’s interesting here is about converting markdown, since you could use it if you get tired of Publii, the current software I’m using for this blog you’re seeing. </p>
<h4 id="image-layout-property">Image layout property</h4>
<p>Setting the layout property of an image as “responsive” it’ll fill up the container where it is. </p>
<h4 id="translating-markdown-to-jsx">Translating MarkDown to JSX</h4>
<p>Use <a href="https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown">react-markdown</a>, it takes markdown and outputs it as JSX. </p>
<p>A common approach is to have a folder named “content”. You use gray matter to add metadata to markdown</p>
<p>UUse another package too called <a href="https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter">gray-matter</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">----
title: Some title
date: 2022-20-15
author: yourself
excerpt: ....
image: ....
----

And here the markdown
</code></pre>
<p>You can use <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/25146246#overview">this</a> video as reference. </p>
<h4 id="getstaticprops-needs-getstaticpath">getStaticProps needs getStaticPath</h4>
<p>This is the case for all the pages that are dynamically created. </p>
<h4 id="rendering-images">Rendering images</h4>
<p>Change ReactMarkdown to render img tags as Images in NextJS with customRenderers</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const customRenderers = {		
        paragraph(paragraph) {
        const { node} = paragraph
        if (node.children[0].type === &quot;image&#39;) {
        const image = node.children[0];
        return &lt;div className={classes.image}&gt;
            &lt;Image src={image.src} alt={image.alt} width={image.with} height={image.height}/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            .....
            }
            return &lt;p&gt;{paragraph.children}&lt;/p&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="code-snippets-in-colours">Code snippets in colours</h4>
<p>Same, override the above with </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter">React-syntax-highlighter</a> is the package you’ll need. </p>
<h2 id="section-12-deploying-nextjs-apps">Section 12: Deploying NextJS Apps</h2>
<h4 id="next-export">Next Export</h4>
<p>It’s just a command that creates a 100% full static app and doesnt’ require a NodeJS server. But that means you cannot use API routes, server-side pages, nor page revalidations. </p>
<h4 id="nextconfigjs">next.config.js</h4>
<p>It’s better to just <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js">check the docs</a> for this. It has hundreds of options. </p>
<h4 id="optimising-prism-syntax-highlighter">Optimising Prism (syntax highlighter)</h4>
<p>Choose only the languages you want to import. </p>
<h2 id="section-13-adding-authentication">Section 13: Adding Authentication</h2>
<p>You  could use this to share post pages that are unlisted. You already know everything about JSON Web Tokens. </p>
<p>You could also use this to connect blog posts to projects to clients if clients had their own logins. That would also allow them to access a Dashboard with information of how their project goes: hours used, links to artifacts, contracts, </p>
<h4 id="nextauth">NextAuth</h4>
<p>Is like PassportJs. <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/25146422#overview">This</a> video explains it better how it works but you’d rather, if you ever use it, go to the documentation. </p>
<h4 id="usesession">useSession</h4>
<p>You imoprt it from next-auth/client and gives you {session, logging} from useSession. </p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const {session, logging} = useSession();
</code></pre>
<h4 id="signout">SignOut</h4>
<p>Tha’ts another function from next-auth/client to sign out.</p>
<h4 id="page-guards-client-side">Page Guards (client side)</h4>
<p>I prefer the server-side part. </p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import {getSession} from &#39;next-auth/client&#39;;

getSession().then(() =&gt; loading=true))

if (loading) {
    // do whatever
    else {
    // do whatever
    }
</code></pre>
<h4 id="page-guards-server-side">Page Guards (server side)</h4>
<p>You’d obviously need getServerSideProps because this can’t be static. </p>
<p>It’s very simple, just get if the uer is logged and pass the session, otherwise redirect them elsewhere (to the /auth page)</p>
<h2 id="done">Done!</h2>
<p>The two final sections are a summary and a round up so no need to do them. I’m finished with NextJS learning. </p>

<p>Welcome to my blog, where I've consolidated all my previous WordPress and Jekyll posts into one place. My goal now is to reorganize everything and create a coherent structure.</p>
<p>I'm transitioning from maikel.uk to maikel.dev, and this blog will reside at blog.maikel.dev.</p>
<h2>So, who am I?</h2>
<p>I'm Maikel, a European-based freelance full-stack software engineer and cloud architect. My expertise lies in integrating software solutions and managing the cloud infrastructure they rely on.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I've successfully transformed ideas from non-technical companies into reality.</p>
<p>Living currently in Seville, I'm actively seeking long-term contracts. I'm determined to demonstrate that #Mastodon and the #Fediverse can be a valuable platform for finding job opportunities or clients.</p>
<p>As a full-stack software engineer and cloud architect, my interests encompass Angular, React, Python, data science, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, Jenkins, Terraform, and Ansible. You can find more information about these topics on the homepage of this site.</p>
<p>When it comes to music, I enjoy progressive trance, lo-fi, and post-rock. As an audiophile, I have a penchant for quality audio and own Sony XM4 headphones (which I use the most), Aftershokz Titanium for running, and Senheisser 599 for optimal sound experience.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I'm gay and haven't married or had children. Although I don't have any pets of my own, I'm particularly fond of cats and have one of my flatmate at home. I identify as an atheist but maintain a tolerant attitude towards religions.</p>
<p>My hobbies include wandering and urban exploration, which means I possess an intimate knowledge of the streets in any city comparable to that of a certified taxi driver.</p>
<p>I'm here to connect with friends, clients, and potential employers.</p>
<h2>Places I've lived</h2>
<ul>
<li>London, UK</li>
<li>Manchester, UK</li>
<li>Liverpool, UK</li>
<li>Blackpool, UK</li>
<li>Cadiz, Spain</li>
<li>Barcelona, Spain</li>
<li>Seville, Spain</li>
<li>Andorra la Vella, Principality of Andorra</li>

                    <p><img src="https://blog.maikel.dev/media/posts/21/clemens-van-lay-5eThdzpVqyE-unsplash.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>

<p>If I were in London I would know exactly what to do and when. I'd start by checking Reed.co.uk, CW-Jobs and other jobsites to have a good grasp of what's available when doing simple searches. But by no means would I believe what I've seen there as representative of what is truly available. It's just an appetizer.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Jobsites are not even the tip of the iceberg. Most jobs are filled without them ever being posted on the internet. Someone at the company knows someone, who knows someone and is in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Being <strong>in the right place </strong>on <strong>the right time. </strong>This is what gets you the job you want. And that was my strategy in Andorra in 2007. So today I'm gathering knowledge from the past to see how can I apply it right now in El Puerto. My life is different, my skillset <strong>vastly </strong>different for starters I have one, therefore the type of job I can afford to get <strong>today </strong>is nowhere similar to the very limited options I had 15 years ago.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My strategy in Andorra was to be <strong>ubiquitous</strong>. It wasn't hard to be honest, just need to know a vast amount of people in a tiny city and ensure they all know what you're looking for, that you're available and how to contact you. That country is tiny, so contacting the HR manager of every known company wasn't really hard, most of them are literally working in the same street (Meritxell Avenue, the only High Street of Andorra/Escaldes). Gathering the information to know who was who, maybe that was harder. Internet wasn't in 2007 what it is today. Today you can just open Linkedin to know who is in charge of hiring on every company.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My strategy in London, couldn't be the same, because London, unlike Andorra, isn't tiny. You can only be ubiquitous in London if you're the Queen. So there my strategy was to be known by the right companies. It involved more research about where was each located, who was in charge of hiring and what they were into. London was the hardest and yet luck was a very big factor. It was a couple of key people who got me the foot on the door.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Seville was maybe, the simplest. In the UK you can't just walk into a company and say "hi, I'm hireable, here is my CV", but Andalusia is the opposite, you can literally just do that. No one would use GDPR as an excuse to avoid taking your CV, people are nosy and bored at work.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In Seville, in 2010 my approach was to locate in the map a couple of <strong>high density </strong>business centres. One was the 5 towers of Nuevo Torneo, followed by the other 6 towers nearby. The other was the 4 to 5 contiguous office buildings just after entering East Seville. I literally walked, with 20 copies of my CV made for every possible job I could imagine I was good at, generic but not too generic, I was looking for office and IT-oriented jobs, and handed it over to the hiring manager on every office. If he or she wasn't there I didn't waste paper. I put emphasis on the 20 copies because it is probably no more than it took me to start working for Clearwire.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Hiring is a game of putting yourself in the shoes of the hiring manager. From their perspective, you're being <strong>auctioned</strong>. They know you're hireable for a <strong>very</strong> limited time, once you find a job you're out of the market. Their opportunity is lost, your talent is elsewhere.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the UK being ubiquitous requires an online presence. Emails back and forth to the right people at the right companies. Too much networking.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>El Puerto is, weird. It's a strange city that I can't place nor compare to any of the other places I've been. It has an industry but I can't figure the size of it, it is <strong>not </strong>only dedicated to tourism, even though that's the appearance it kind of gives.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One of the companies that has eScooters for hire is based in this city, I can't figure out why when they don't even offer that service here. They were only operating in Seville and Cádiz (the capital city, not the province). More and more companies are taking up space in the Salinas business area nearby my home. I wonder how cheap or convenient is the square metre there. In a nutshell, El Puerto has the appearance of non-tourism orientated <strong>growth </strong>and if I can, for once, be part of that I would love to.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I run away from this city in 2007, never looked back, gave it for lost, accepted all jobs that could be taken in this city were in the waitressing industry. But now, so many years later, I have the strong feeling that has changed and this city may be becoming the economic engine of the Bay. Which sounds exciting because it means I might be able to settle down back in my hometown.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Sure, London is exciting, travelling wherever, living in Barcelona, or having the right to work in Andorra (which isn't easy at all) makes you feel special but....I never wanted special. I want, <strong>home</strong>. The place where my body is accustomed to its weather, the place where the food is what I've grown up eating, the place where family and most friends are. The place I want to have <strong>a mortgage</strong> in.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So here I am, this is what I had:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Remote working 24/7</li>
<li>My own schedule organised by me.</li>
<li>I could choose what tech to use for each page, service, website. Including what programming language and framework.</li>
<li>A salary that allowed me to not worry about money.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is what I offer now:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Don't care about remote or going to an office. Unless the office has air conditioning in which case I prefer it.</li>
<li>Knowledge of Python, JavaScript, back-end &amp; front-end frameworks. Self-directed learning whenever I need some extra knowledge on anything.</li>
<li>An upper second-class honours degree on Computing and IT by the Open University.</li>
<li>A brain that never stops.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is what I want now:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Permanency. I don't want more project work, more fixed date work. I want my new job to be my last job. The one I'll do all the way to my retirement.</li>
<li>In the Cadiz Bay.</li>
<li>I want an amount of fixed hours per week. No more 24/7 monitoring of website A, B, C running smoothly and having to be no more than 1km away from my laptop to fix anything at 3am looking at Nagios/Sensu.</li>
<li>Clear definition of my duties. I don't want to run ever again an entire software engineering department. It's bad for my skillset.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm looking for clients in the PCT (Scientific and Techno Park in Spanish) Cartuja and I'm going to describe here what I'm doing exactly for future reference. This could work as a model of what to do in the future, in other places, based in the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-dry-development">DRY </a>principle of software engineering.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first thing I did to make it a bit fun was to have a very long, ride around every street in the area to get a good grasp of the buildings, the locations, the names of the streets, browsing where the main divisions are. I've noticed in some bits it's all medical, other bits of the place are taken by the University of Seville's campus. Not all of the Cartuja island is useful to me then. It seems all that could matter is <strong>in the middle section</strong>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I shall not forget about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estadio_de_La_Cartuja">Stadium</a>, because apart from sport events it has also offices. Even though Wikipedia makes no mention of it. In any case it has its own <a href="https://www.estadiolacartuja.es/">website</a>. I know there's a company called Inn Offices that rents spaces in the Stadium but they don't seem to have a directory of companies and start ups running <strong>with </strong>them. I know their website is <a href="https://innoffices.es/alquiler-de-oficinas/">this</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On the website of the PCT there is a section of jobs <a href="https://www.pctcartuja.es/es/ofertas-de-empleo.html">here</a> but I'm not very keen on it as I'm not eager to become anyone's employee. I rather stay independent unless it's strictly necessary to change that or someone makes a really enticing offer.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Today I'm doing just a bit of discovery and gathering tasks to do at the end of this post.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The directory of companies is <a href="https://www.pctcartuja.es/es/established-companies-pctcartuja.html">here</a> and it seems they are exactly 493. I shouldn't assume that directory is updated.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>The goal</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To be re-employed ASAP.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>How to measure it?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In time and steps, the number of steps it takes me to get clients and the number of days. The reason to measure it is so that I can compare in the future, methods of client of client gathering. Today is day zero. To gather the number of steps I should work backwards from what works, using these posts as reference.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>To do:</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Check the <a href="https://www.estadiolacartuja.es/">website</a> of the stadium.</li>
<li>Read the <a href="https://www.pctcartuja.es/es/ofertas-de-empleo.html">vacancies</a> website of the PCT.</li>
<li>Everyone around me should know I'm open to opportunities. <strong>Make them </strong>aware.</li>
<li>Read the website of the <a href="https://www.pctcartuja.es/es">PCT</a> itself. Find what's useful there.</li>
<li>Use Scrapy to download the entire directory. Or just copy and paste the tables, actually.</li>
<li>Publish this post.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Distractions:</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Starbucks as a location to do some work is a double-edged sword. On one side, the air con makes it nice, when it'll be <strong>absolutely bloody awful</strong> elsewhere, and the constant movement of people keeps me somehow focused. On the other side the feeling of needing to purchase something every hour (not that anyone asks me to do so) makes me never stay here more than 1 hour. What I need is a place where I can stay for at least four hours then continue from home.</li>
<li>Friends bothering me through WhatsApp. Maybe I should tell them from X to Y time I'm busy.</li>
<li>Had to get an evaporative air cooler. Considering Seville is extra dry, it is the perfect city to use this kind of coolers and save a ton of money in air conditioning.</li>
<li>This site isn't working on mobile, the menu button doesn't do anything. Fix the upper left button. Otherwise this blog is unnacesible from the home page.</li>

<p>This post is going to run for a while. I've invested the last couple of weeks in quitting caffeine. I've been caffeine free for 2 weeks, right now I'm heading back to it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Why am I going back to coffee?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dullness. Life becomes meaningless without it. It's not an state of depression after the 3rd day but a state of carelessness. It is literally the opposite from caring too much about everything to not caring at all. What I want is balance and to get balance I'm going to need coffee. So what I need to mind about is the tolerance to it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm going to drink just enough to have a meaningful workout and sleep whenever needed. So if that coffee makes me sleepy, I'm sleeping. Same as my calories are distributed throughout the day I'm going to let the sleeping hours do the same.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Rethinking the gym routine.</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I haven't gone to the gym either, the lack of care for life of quitting coffee had made going to the gym a shore. Which is another of the reasons I'm going back or specifically going back to coffee pre-workout <strong>only. </strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I've tried to no avail for 2 weeks to rotate my sleeping pattern to wake up at 4:30am and I simply can't without the aid of coffee. Even the sleeping pills (Dormidina) only help me sleep a couple of hours during the day when I try to sleep early. So I haven't gone at all to the gym.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm quit maintenance now and head for heavy fat loss.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>So I've gone to the gym after having 1 coffee and it cost me nothing, it's really MUCH more pleasurable to go caffeinated than decaf. I also remade my workout routine (pec/back everyday except when legs in a configuration of day 1, day legs, day 2, day legs) so I train every major muscle (pec &amp; back) more often.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>This blog</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I should stick to one post until that post is completed. If there are multiple subjects within that post I should chunk them only when writing in that post is over once it becomes too big.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Where am I living?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is one of the most annoying subjects because it is heavily interconnected to other subjects. Facts:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Where I live might dictate where I can work, unless I count remote. That is, I could find a remote work and stay wherever I actually want.</li>
<li>The sensible thing would be to stay nearby for as long as the armpit surgery is done.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Health stuff and location</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Teeth</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This week's 8th of April (Friday) I'm getting, in theory, the aligners put back on. That means freedom to move around for 3 months from that date. So in theory until July I can be wherever. In reality this become a non-issue if I simply get a job within Cadiz province. In an ideal scenario I'd like to stay in Spain until my teeth treatment is fully done.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Armpits</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm in waiting list. In theory I'm there for up to six months. The doctor said they usually perform it within 3 months. But online news says on average Puerta del Mar (the hospital) has a 160 days waiting list. That means it can take until October for me to get the surgery.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Technically I could move wherever as far as it's somewhere that allows me to come back. The problem is not what I do while I'm out. The problem is once I get the surgery I might not be able to do anything (I'd be temporarily incapacitated) for a few weeks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So where am I moving in May is the main question that this post intends to answer. The price of anything for May in AirBnB negates not working, meaning it is entirely unaffordable without a job. If I stay in Cádiz I would need to pull out a favour. What I would like:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol>
<li>A good gym where I can train without it being at ridiculous AM.</li>
<li>Green areas to walk around, pine forest or just forests.</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So this table is the 3 options that come to mind right now but I'm not limited to them.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:table {"className":"is-style-stripes"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> </th>
<th>Cadiz Province</th>
<th>Madrid</th>
<th>London</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Pros</td>
<td>* Dentist and armpit surgery location troubles solved. <br>* Most friends are here. <br>* Luismi is here<br>* Known gyms<br>* Good only if lucky and found cheap accommodation. <br>* I don't have to move all my stuff. <br>* If Chiclana, San Fernando or El Puerto then it's more interesting. <br>* The most sensible counting with the time you're going to be temporarily incapacitated post surgery.</td>
<td>* More affordable in summer.<br>* Big city. <br>* New city, exciting. <br>* Puts me closer to home ownership as I might get a job within Spain. <br>* Surely has more than one good gym. <br>* Easier to get a bigger salary. <br>* Might help me delink my career from the UK.</td>
<td>* Some friends might let me stay at theirs until I find long-term options. <br>* Many friends in London<br>* Renewal of the 5 years of the indefinite leave to remain. <br>* Might be the easiest to get highest possible income. <br>* Good gyms everywhere. <br>* Places to run everywhere. <br>* Cooler in summer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cons</td>
<td>* Unaffordable in summer.<br>* Hot in summer. <br>* Sameness, boring, dull if the capital. <br>* Finding a job is harder. You have to basically relay only on remote working as salaries on the province are laughable on anything. <br>* There's no IT industry.</td>
<td>* Got to travel to get to dentist/surgery.<br>* Have to move all my stuff or keep it in my aunts place.</td>
<td>* Got to take a plane to get to dentist/surgery.<br>* Sameness. <br>* Can't use the eScooter. <br>* Can't take most of my stuff.</td>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You could have your meals at a fix hour. <br>No coffee. <br>4 meals, maybe 6am, 10am, 2pm, 6pm. That's 1 every 4 hours and a 12 hours fast. <br>30 grams of protein on each meal. <br>Every meal should have greens or at least lettuce. <br>What's the goal? To slowly drift into 14% body fat <strong>without </strong>losing muscle (body recomp). We know it works by knowing the weight you lift remains the same as today 17/03/2022 in workit.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I need to go out.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>New health goals</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I don't want more muscle, I want less fat. Keeping the muscle is a priority while losing the fat. You need goals, changes in routine that are sustainable and traceable for progression:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol>
<li>Try a 3 times per week weigh lifting and see if you can still lift the same after 3 weeks.</li>
<li>You shouldn't track weight, when you do you go too quick. You can glance at it.</li>
<li>You shouldn't track body fat even though 14% is the goal.</li>
<li>Track the exercise you do. HIIT and LISS to be specific. Specially LISS.</li>
<li>Your goal every day is to go to sleep exhausted. So the opposite of what you're currently doing.</li>
<li>Calories is all that you should track.</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Real questions</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>How do I add cardio when there's nowhere likeable to run in Cádiz?</li>
<li>Can I increase my BMR (basal metabolic rate) ?</li>
<li>Once you get the key you can put the scooter on the storage room.</li>
</ul>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Basic Meal Plan</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At 2359 calories total it should be divided in:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Carbs: 295 grams</li>
<li>Fat: 79 grams</li>
<li>Protein: 118 grams</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That's per meal of 74 carbs, 20 fat, 30 protein when spread in 4 meals.</p>

<p>This is a personal project of a learning platform. I wanted to facilitate the acquisition of skills by controlling the status of each one of them, knowing where to update them, which ones do I already know, etc. While having an interface to write notes about them and test my own knowledge. As a result I built my own self-directed learning CMS on Angular 4, Node, Express and MongoDB on an Amazon EC3 Ubuntu container.</p>
