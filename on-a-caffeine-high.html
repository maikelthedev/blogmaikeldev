We start it by realising I've been waiting 2 months for the Invisalign aligners to arrive when they were never going to do so. The appointment I had for the 27th of January wasn't to get them put back on, I was lied. That appointment was to get the measurements and reorder them. Not only that I was again lied on that occasion.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This wouldn't matter much shall I have not paid in advance for my whole treatment and I was imprisoned with my current clinic. So I ended up moving the treatment to another one, closer, I no longer have to commute to Seville to see my dentist now I have it here. But I'm still wasting time in a limbo until they send them my whole dental history. This is half a victory. On a good note, the new dentist believes he won't need to take two of my healthy teeth out to make space.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This whole money situation made me really nervous, I knew it is either now I fix my teeth or not in the foreseeable future. So it made me really anxious. But to be fair, I'm glad I have my dentist nearby now.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id="freedom-awaits">Freedom awaits</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Shortly I'd be able to redirect all my working efforts to do what I please, which is to learn as much as possible in the shortest span of time possible, at all times.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That also means I will be able to pursue other streams of income and this is what has me wondering the most about the future.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But I want routine. I've come to the realisation that there's nothing I love more than routine. Going to the gym has made me aware of this more than ever. I get a baseline that works, then I work on that baseline. Something that others might deem boring I find creative. I evolve the routine from "working" to "being the most efficient". With the gym, I have no doubts the way I'm doing it is the most efficient <strong>right now</strong>. And yet there's plenty of room for improvement, it is that room for improvement what keeps me entertained. And it is the fact that this can all be applied to all other matters of life, especially work, what has me looking forward to be able to think for 3 months in just, this.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Regarding new streams of income some ideas come to mind:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>I should write mobile apps non-stop, get better at failing with them just to learn to write them quickly.</li><li>I'm never going to be financially independent unless I work for no one. Working for others will never give me job stability.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Now I wonder what I'd like to do, whether to start straight-away looking for that source of income or have relaxed holidays. I honestly don't think I'm capable of the latter, for the very same reason I said above, I'm a routine-junkie, I love routine, I love structure.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But as my favourite quote says:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Process saves us from the poverty of our intentions.</p><p><cite>by Elizabeth King</cite></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>So I want to have a timeline or what I'm doing. My last day for them is the 20th of February so roughly in 20 days. I'm basically picking up from where I left on January 2019 when I started this solopreneur odyssey. I just want to polish the edges of what hasn't worked so far and carry on with what worked fine.</p><p></p><p></p><p>My goal is pretty simple, I want to make enough money to not have to worry about the stability of it while at the same time do something rewarding for it. The quickest path to reward is doing whatever increases my skillset, doing that makes me happy. But the problem I've seen with the last 3 years is I never demanded a payrise to go with it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I want to buy a house, I could have done that on my current salary yet the instability of it is what prevented me from even trying. In other words: <strong>I put all my eggs on the same unreliable basket.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>And the funny thing is I didn't have to, my skillset is rock solid, it was my client who wasn't.</p><p></p><p></p><p>One of the main things I want to do is avoid entirely having to go to London.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id="back-to-my-routine">Back to my routine.</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The centre of my routine is going to be, as it is now: <strong>health. </strong>I've come to realise when I put that as the top-most priority I'm at my happiest.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If I didn't have to go find another job I'll even get a comprehensive health insurance.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So my new routine has to include:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Health stuff<ul><li>Doing HIIT. Preferably in the morning.</li><li>Getting to 13% body fat.</li><li>Eating healthier.</li><li>Mind stuff: going out, exploring, preferably with other people.</li></ul></li><li>Work stuff<ul><li>Invest in skillset</li><li>Putting it to practice, actually earning money.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on Monday, 26 June 2023</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.maikel.dev%2Fon-a-caffeine-high.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Facebook"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://blog.maikel.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://wa.me/?text=On%20a%20caffeine%20high https%3A%2F%2Fblog.maikel.dev%2Fon-a-caffeine-high.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Share with WhatsApp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://blog.maikel.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.maikel.dev%2Fon-a-caffeine-high.html" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://blog.maikel.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://blog.maikel.dev/authors/maikel/" title="Maikel">Maikel</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://blog.maikel.dev/crash-diet.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://blog.maikel.dev/media/posts/40/responsive/thought-catalog-fnztlIb52gU-unsplash-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1280" width="1920"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Crash diet</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://blog.maikel.dev/learning-cms.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Learning CMS</h5></div><img src="https://blog.maikel.dev/media/posts/14/responsive/visitor-xs.png" loading="lazy" alt="" height="800" width="1280"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Follow us</h3><div class="follow"><a href="https://fedi.maikel.dev/@maikel" class="twitter" aria-label="Twitter"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://blog.maikel.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> Twitter </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maikelthedev/" class="linkedin" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://blog.maikel.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> LinkedIn</a></div></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://blog.maikel.dev/tags/diary/">diary</a> <span class="u-small">(11)</span></li><li><a href="https://blog.maikel.dev/tags/dieting/">dieting</a> <span class="u-small">(9)</span></li><li><a href="https://blog.maikel.dev/tags/guides/">guides</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li><li><a href="https://blog.maikel.dev/tags/introductions/">introductions</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li><li><a href="https://blog.maikel.dev/tags/jobhunting/">jobhunting</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://blog.maikel.dev/">Maikel&#x27;s Blog</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__follow"><a href="https://fedi.maikel.dev/@maikel" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.maikel.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maikelthedev/" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.maikel.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Maikel OÜ</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
