I’ve seen how hideously slow SPA are on regularly powered computers. </li>\n<li>I think React has far more future than Angular will ever have. </li>\n<li>I ‘d like to do the Fedigrindr app using this too.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"section-1-getting-started\">Section 1: Getting started</h2>\n<p>The simplest way to create an app is to use:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npx create-next-app\n</code></pre>\n<p>on the shell console. </p>\n<p>Shortcut to format document: Ctlr+Shift-i </p>\n<p>A NextJS app seems to be a monolitic node app. </p>\n<h3 id=\"why-not-choose-use-app-router\">Why not choose use App Router?</h3>\n<p>Because otherwise you create a different folder structure instead of the pages. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-2-react-refresher\">Section 2: React Refresher</h2>\n<p>ReactJS is used (same as Angular) to make pages reactive, seem instant. Also is all about components. Webs divided in smaller parts. </p>\n<p>Also to create a basic skeleton of a React app. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npx create-react-app\n</code></pre>\n<p>useState is a bit confusing. </p>\n<p>Default router he uses:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install --save react-router-dom@5\n</code></pre>\n<p>All the routing thing is boring since I know already what this all is. The only thing I neede to remember is that to pass properties you just pass them in props and every React object has props, e.g.:</p>\n<h4 id=\"how-to-pass-properties-to-children\">How to pass properties to children</h4>\n<p>This can also be used to pass actions to the parents. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">// Some parent object\nreturn (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n       &lt;ChildComponent someText=&quot;hello&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n)\n\n// Some child component becomes:\nfunction ChildComponent(props) { //Props need to be defined here otherwise can&#39;t be accessed. \n\nreturn (\n   &lt;div&gt;\n             &lt;h1&gt;{props.someText}&lt;/h1&gt;\n     &lt;/div&gt;\n     )\n     \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Don’t use normla links as they’ll be sent to the server which is redundant. Use “LInk” instead. </p>\n<h4 id=\"render-a-list-of-jsx-elements\">Render a list of JSX elements</h4>\n<p>Note that each element of a list must have an (unique) ID added as the key prop.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">&lt;h1&gt;Some list&lt;/h1&gt;\n{DUMMY_DATA.map((single) =&gt; {\n    return &lt;SomeChildComponent key={single.id} title={single.title}} /&gt;\n})}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I need to remember change this Harvest task to NextJS-course I want to know exaclty how much time I’ve invested on this by the end of it. </p>\n<h4 id=\"passing-content-to-another-component\">Passing content to another component</h4>\n<p>Use props.children</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">&lt;Example&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Something else&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/Example&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Won’t render unless you pass props.children such as inside the Example component</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n        {props.children\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now whatever content was after the tag will be rendered too inside. That’s how you use Wrapper components (e.g.: Card). </p>\n<h4 id=\"prevent-form-submission\">Prevent form submission.</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">\nfunction submitHandler(event) { // You need event here\n  event.preventDefault() // this is what actually prevents the form submission. \n    }\n\nreturn (\n&lt;form onSubmit={submitHandler}&gt; ....thje form content &lt;/form&gt;\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"useref-to-use-the-details-of-a-form\">UseRef to use the details of a form</h4>\n<p>This is a ref prop that is used to get an element through a referent object, example. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const titleInputRef = useRef();\n\nfunction submit( ) {\n    const enteredTitle = titleInputRef.current.value;\n    someLogic(enteredTitle);\n}\n\nreturn (\n&lt;form&gt;\n        &lt;input ref={titleInputRef} /&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"reminder-how-to-send-http-request\">Reminder, how to send HTTP request.</h4>\n<p>Lots of packages, for this as usual. fetch() is the one built in. Example for POST request.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">fetch(\n    &#39;SOMEURL&#39;, \n    {\n        method: &quot;POST&quot;,\n        body: theData // Use JSON.stringify if needed\n        headers: \n            {\n            &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json\n            }\n    }\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>You could use Redis here for simplicity while testing</p>\n<h4 id=\"using-usehistory-to-navigate\">Using useHistory to navigate</h4>\n<p>import it from the router. </p>\n<p>then add </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const history = useHistory() // to the function \n\n//Imagine you have a fetch and want to trigger going somewhere\n\nfetch(DOSOMETHING).then(\n    history.replace(&#39;/somerelativepath&#39;);\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"reminder-on-how-to-fetch-data\">Reminder on how to fetch data</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">fetch(&#39;someURL&#39;).then(response =&gt; {\n        return response.json() // To convert it to JSON\n    }).then(data =&gt; {\n        doSomethingWith(data)\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<p>Very probably other libraries don’t require to convert to manually to json as a step. </p>\n<h4 id=\"using-usestate-for-loading\">Using useState for loading</h4>\n<p>Use state to change what’s visible on the screen while loading. Beware a fetch should have a useEffect to avoid running for all eternity. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import {useState] from &quot;react&quot;\n\nconst [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);\n\n// Then on the fetch function change it to call setIsLoading(false)\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"using-useeffect-to-avoid-runnning-loops\">Using useEffect to avoid runnning loops</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">useEffect(() =&gt; {\n            fetch(....)\n        }, \n        [isLoading ] // Check the values on this array before executing the rest of the effect (the fetch), so in this case isLoading won&#39;t execute again. In this case isLoading shouldn&#39;t be there, and by being empty it&#39;ll only run once. \n        );\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"react-context\">React Context</h4>\n<p>Common convention is to set up a Store folder. Alternatives to RC is Redux. </p>\n<p>To create a context</p>\n<pre><code>import {createContext, useState} from &quot;react&quot;;\n\nconst YourContext = createContext({\n    users:  [ ],\n    totalUsers: 0\n});\n// You also need a provider of that context\nfunction YourContextProivider(props) {\n// Here you can manage state same as in any other React component. \n    const [users, setUsers] = useState([ ]);\n    \n    const context = {\n        users: users,\n        titalUserS: users.length\n    };\n    \n    return (\n    &lt;YourContext.Provider value={context}&gt;\n        {props.children}\n    &lt;/YourContext.Provider&gt;\n    )\n</code></pre>\n<p>I think it’s a singleton. You could save this as yourcontext-context.js in the store folder. \nThe hook to access that one would be useContext</p>\n<h4 id=\"how-to-use-usecontext\">How to use useContext</h4>\n<p>Well, same as useState, etc. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import {UserContext} from  from &quot;whervever&quot;\nconst userContext = useContext(UserContext);\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"section-3-pages--file-based-routing\">Section 3: Pages &amp; File-based routing</h2>\n<p>With file-based routing you simply create a file to route to it, inside the pages folder. If you want to create a folder the main one should be called index.js and all others will be subpages of that main one (whose name is the folder name).</p>\n<p>For stuff that’s dinamic use folders and filenames with [id] or [client]</p>\n<p>You could also use […slug] for pages that are of a blog (slug can be anything) or any Catch-all routes</p>\n<h4 id=\"link-advantages\">Link advantages</h4>\n<p>By using link it prefetches anything from the link as soon as you hoover it. </p>\n<h4 id=\"navigate-programatically\">Navigate programatically</h4>\n<p>Use router.push(‘theroute’) to go and be able to go back\nUse router.replace(‘theroute’) to go but without being able to go back. </p>\n<h4 id=\"custom-made-404-page\">Custom made 404 page.</h4>\n<p>Just make a 404.js page on the pages folder, give it whatever name you want and it is what will be shown.</p>\n<p>I wonder how long until he explains componentisation so I can design a navigation menu. So far it seems as if every page is its own page. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-4-working-with-file-based-routing\">Section 4: Working with file-based routing</h2>\n<p>If you hae two pages in the same folder and one of them is [eventId] and the other is […slug] the first one will only be picked up as far as the user types the URL with just 1 varaialble, more than one will pick up the second page.</p>\n<p>Create a foldr called components to store all the bits and pieces normal of Angular/React. You can call it whatever you want but that way won’t interfere with file-based pages. </p>\n<p>To use eventId on the example about</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const router = useRouter();\nconst eventId = router.query.eventId;\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"wrapping-it-all-in-a-layout-with-a-header-and-footer\">Wrapping it all in a Layout with a header and footer.</h4>\n<p>Modify _app.js to be wrapped in a Layout wrapper component that has props.children on it. </p>\n<p>I’m not exactly getting what a Fragment is. Ok I get it now thanks to <a href=\"https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment\">this</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"section-5-page-pre-rendering-and-data-fetching\">Section 5: Page Pre-Rendering and Data Fetching</h2>\n<p>This is about SSR (server-side rendering) which is the key feature of NextJs. </p>\n<p>NextJS have to types of pre-rendering, static generation and SSR on the fly. </p>\n<h4 id=\"using-getstaticprops\">Using getStaticProps()</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">export async function getStaticProps(context) {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The function must be written exactly like that and it’ll only execute on the server, never on the client, in fact it’ll be hidden from the client. There’s no window object. You can put DB code there for example. Or read from a filesystem file (useful for markdown or JSON for example). Use the FS module with async/await. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#promise-example\">https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#promise-example</a></p>\n<p>It should return {props: whateverObject}</p>\n<p>You can tell that function to work again on </p>\n<p>You can say it with the props that you return, example</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">return {\n        props: someObject, \n        revalidate: 10 // This would be th enumber of seconds to revalidate. \n        }\n</code></pre>\n<p>That’s incremental static regeneration. </p>\n<h4 id=\"using-redirect\">Using redirect.</h4>\n<p>It’s another key inside getStaticProps where you coudl specify where to send the user in case the page didn’t load or the access to the DB didn’t work for any reason. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">return {\n    redirect: &#39;/404-nodata\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"extracting-context-for-ssr\">Extracting context for SSR.</h4>\n<p>Instead of route.query.eventId (just recycling the example above, you’d use inside the getStaticProps this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">export async function getStaticProps(context) {\n    const { params } = context;\n    const eventId = params.eventId;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"using-getstaticpath\">Using getStaticPath()</h4>\n<p>Default behavior for dynamic pages is not to generate them, such as [eventId]</p>\n<pre><code>export async function getStaticPaths() {\n    return {\n        paths: [\n                {params: {eventId: &quot;1&quot;} }\n                {params: {eventId: &quot;2&quot;} }\n                {params: {eventId: &quot;3&quot;} }\n        ],\n        fallback: false\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"using-fallback-true\">Using fallback: true</h4>\n<p>Using fallback set to true stuff is generated before when first visited. Imagine one as before but with eventId:4. When using this you should put a loading page or something because nothing will be created no the first visit yet. </p>\n<h4 id=\"not-found\">Not found</h4>\n<p>You can return {notFound: true} to send the user to a 404 Not found page in the absence of a product with the ID the user request for example. </p>\n<h4 id=\"using-getserversideprops\">Using getServerSideProps()</h4>\n<p>This one is never statically pre-generated. You get access to params, req and res. Yoo cannot use it with getStaticProps because it wouldn’t make any sense. </p>\n<pre><code>export async function getServerSideProps(context) {\nconst {params, req, res} = context\nreturns { props: thePropsObject} \n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"whats-useswr-hook\">What’s useSWR hook.</h4>\n<p>Is one to use instead of useEffect() to get data from the client side. Just check the docs. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-6-project-time-page-pre-rendering--data-fetching\">Section 6: Project Time: Page Pre-rendering &amp; Data Fetching</h2>\n<p>If you set fallback to blocking on any of the functions of the previous section nothing will be generated until the generation of the data has finished. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-7-optimizing-nextjs-apps\">Section 7: Optimizing NextJS Apps</h2>\n<h4 id=\"the-head-component\">THe head component.</h4>\n<p>It is na import from NetxJS. It works to add stuff between Head tags. You could use it with the _app.js file to have a generic head for all pages. </p>\n<p>If you use the same Head thing in different places with the same values, it takes the later one. </p>\n<h4 id=\"the-_documentjs-file\">The _document.js file</h4>\n<p>I don’t think you’ll ever need this one but if you do check direclty <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/25145892#overview\">this</a> video. It is useful if you want to change the HTML document itself. </p>\n<h4 id=\"optmising-images\">Optmising images</h4>\n<p>This is interesting. Using the Image component NextJS will optimise on the fly the image. Width and Height are mandatory when using this one. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-8-adding-backend-code-with-api-routes-fullstack-react\">Section 8: Adding Backend Code with API Routes (Fullstack React)</h2>\n",

It wasn't hard to be honest, just need to know a vast amount of people in a tiny city and ensure they all know what you're looking for, that you're available and how to contact you. That country is tiny, so contacting the HR manager of every known company wasn't really hard, most of them are literally working in the same street (Meritxell Avenue, the only High Street of Andorra/Escaldes). Gathering the information to know who was who, maybe that was harder. Internet wasn't in 2007 what it is today. Today you can just open Linkedin to know who is in charge of hiring on every company.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>My strategy in London, couldn't be the same, because London, unlike Andorra, isn't tiny. You can only be ubiquitous in London if you're the Queen. So there my strategy was to be known by the right companies. It involved more research about where was each located, who was in charge of hiring and what they were into. London was the hardest and yet luck was a very big factor. It was a couple of key people who got me the foot on the door.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Seville was maybe, the simplest. In the UK you can't just walk into a company and say \"hi, I'm hireable, here is my CV\", but Andalusia is the opposite, you can literally just do that. No one would use GDPR as an excuse to avoid taking your CV, people are nosy and bored at work.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In Seville, in 2010 my approach was to locate in the map a couple of <strong>high density </strong>business centres. One was the 5 towers of Nuevo Torneo, followed by the other 6 towers nearby. The other was the 4 to 5 contiguous office buildings just after entering East Seville. I literally walked, with 20 copies of my CV made for every possible job I could imagine I was good at, generic but not too generic, I was looking for office and IT-oriented jobs, and handed it over to the hiring manager on every office. If he or she wasn't there I didn't waste paper. I put emphasis on the 20 copies because it is probably no more than it took me to start working for Clearwire.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Hiring is a game of putting yourself in the shoes of the hiring manager. From their perspective, you're being <strong>auctioned</strong>. They know you're hireable for a <strong>very</strong> limited time, once you find a job you're out of the market. Their opportunity is lost, your talent is elsewhere.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In the UK being ubiquitous requires an online presence. Emails back and forth to the right people at the right companies. Too much networking.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>El Puerto is, weird. It's a strange city that I can't place nor compare to any of the other places I've been. It has an industry but I can't figure the size of it, it is <strong>not </strong>only dedicated to tourism, even though that's the appearance it kind of gives.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>One of the companies that has eScooters for hire is based in this city, I can't figure out why when they don't even offer that service here. They were only operating in Seville and Cádiz (the capital city, not the province). More and more companies are taking up space in the Salinas business area nearby my home. I wonder how cheap or convenient is the square metre there. In a nutshell, El Puerto has the appearance of non-tourism orientated <strong>growth </strong>and if I can, for once, be part of that I would love to.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I run away from this city in 2007, never looked back, gave it for lost, accepted all jobs that could be taken in this city were in the waitressing industry. But now, so many years later, I have the strong feeling that has changed and this city may be becoming the economic engine of the Bay. Which sounds exciting because it means I might be able to settle down back in my hometown.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Sure, London is exciting, travelling wherever, living in Barcelona, or having the right to work in Andorra (which isn't easy at all) makes you feel special but....I never wanted special. I want, <strong>home</strong>. The place where my body is accustomed to its weather, the place where the food is what I've grown up eating, the place where family and most friends are. The place I want to have <strong>a mortgage</strong> in.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So here I am, this is what I had:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:list --></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remote working 24/7</li>\n<li>My own schedule organised by me.</li>\n<li>I could choose what tech to use for each page, service, website.

I've come to the realisation that there's nothing I love more than routine. Going to the gym has made me aware of this more than ever. I get a baseline that works, then I work on that baseline. Something that others might deem boring I find creative. I evolve the routine from \"working\" to \"being the most efficient\". With the gym, I have no doubts the way I'm doing it is the most efficient <strong>right now</strong>. And yet there's plenty of room for improvement, it is that room for improvement what keeps me entertained. And it is the fact that this can all be applied to all other matters of life, especially work, what has me looking forward to be able to think for 3 months in just, this.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Regarding new streams of income some ideas come to mind:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:list --></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I should write mobile apps non-stop, get better at failing with them just to learn to write them quickly.</li>\n<li>I'm never going to be financially independent unless I work for no one. Working for others will never give me job stability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Now I wonder what I'd like to do, whether to start straight-away looking for that source of income or have relaxed holidays. I honestly don't think I'm capable of the latter, for the very same reason I said above, I'm a routine-junkie, I love routine, I love structure.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>But as my favourite quote says:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:quote --></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Process saves us from the poverty of our intentions.</p>\n<p><cite>by Elizabeth King</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So I want to have a timeline or what I'm doing. My last day for them is the 20th of February so roughly in 20 days. I'm basically picking up from where I left on January 2019 when I started this solopreneur odyssey. I just want to polish the edges of what hasn't worked so far and carry on with what worked fine.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>My goal is pretty simple, I want to make enough money to not have to worry about the stability of it while at the same time do something rewarding for it. The quickest path to reward is doing whatever increases my skillset, doing that makes me happy. But the problem I've seen with the last 3 years is I never demanded a payrise to go with it.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I want to buy a house, I could have done that on my current salary yet the instability of it is what prevented me from even trying.

While at 5 I play normal, while at 11 I just look at all possible movements. It's exactly as above.</li>\n<li>The weightlifting in a fasted state does not bother my performance in the slightest.</li>\n<li>On the third day it becomes impossible to continue. That was the day I dropped HIIT, I simply couldn't do it.</li>\n<li>I could feel on the third day I couldn't go any heavier nor train at my strongest, unlike the previous too.</li>\n<li>It could be caused by having had the fast started wayyy too early this third day at around 2pm instead of 6pm. I should have kept it consistent.

Other times I've done it I just ate anything in low amounts without paying much attention to macros.</li>\n<li>I've eaten roughly 1200 calories only per day during this period.</li>\n<li>All I'm losing is obviously water and if I were back on a bulk I would just regain it just as quick.

Chosing a figure I can't go above despite cycling bulking/cutting.</li>\n<li>That figure could be 70 kgs because anything above that and I start looking bloated.</li>\n<li>Limiting the amount of protein shakes taken per day can also help with water retention. I can do this by getting more daily doses protein from meat and fish instead of liquid forms.</li>\n<li>Strangely the more water I drink, the less I seem to flush out.</li>\n<li>Consuming creatine or not makes no difference to water retention. While not consuming it, shortly starts to affect my performance when weightlifting.</li>\n<li>This diet is not feasible for longer periods than 3 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>",
