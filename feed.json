            "content_html": "<h2 id=\"relationship-with-the-fediverse\">Relationship with the fediverse</h2>\n<p>I normally think a lot about the way I interact with the #fediverse thinking whether I am making the most of it or becoming just part of the entertainment. I think it needs to be a 50/50 relationship. You must supply positive interaction while getting the same back. </p>\n<p>And I think I need to cut down on my tooting, because otherwise I’m just in the same place I was when I used Facebook. Also I need more real-life contact with people and this is kind of becoming too…hmm….how do I put it: <strong>addictive</strong></p>\n<p>And in a really bad way. </p>\n<p>The transition is really slow, but slowly you notice how you either:\na) slowly shift toward writing what others find interesting. \nb) suddenly having an awarenes of “a)” happening and bluntly doing the opposite. </p>\n<p>In either case you feel how your sense of “self” starts to fade, and to recover that selfness you need to detox a little. So I might start doing that. </p>\n<p><strong>HOW?</strong> Focusing on less worrying and more on doing, with takes me to the next subject:</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-worrying-a-useful-feelingaction\">Is worrying a useful feeling/action?</h2>\n<p>This morning I took a long detour from the gym back home, I really needed some fresh air and quality me-time. Sometimes the best way to get in contact with yourself is to escape to nature. That doesn’t abound in Seville except in the riverside, both of them. </p>\n<p>And in the process I started thinking, one was about my company of which I’ll talk on the next subject, the other was how much time do I waste worrying and whether I achieve anything meaningful by worrying, at all or is one of those useless feelings. </p>\n<p>I don’t think worrying achieves anything, in fact I’m starting to believe it is a <strong>toxic</strong> action. Why?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It gives you a fake sense of “doing” something, when you actually aren’t. </li>\n<li>In terms of actions, the only thing it does is to rephrase the problem you have again in again in your head without actually giving you any answers. Wouldn’t it be quicker to write them down in a notepad, than repeating the same action every day?</li>\n<li>The frustration of not having any immediate answers to any of the questions that feed the worrying phase, only paralyse you, damage your self-esteem the more you repeat the same question over a number of days, leads you to nowhere, solves nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But what would I do instead. I can’t think of those questions without worrying, is not as if one could live a worry free life. </p>\n<p>These are complex questions of which I won’t get any answer quickly. I just think I should cut on the worrying and spend more time doing. If those questions don’t have an answer today, maybe let them settle for a bit on their own while I actually do something useful with the time I would have spent otherwise doing worrying, meaning nothing. </p>\n<p>So what to do instead? How about a course on Elixir, how about more time creating meaningful processes for my company? This leads me to the next subject:</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-maikel-oüs-unique-selling-point-usp\">What is Maikel OÜ’s Unique-Selling Point (USP)</h2>\n<p><em>Note: assume whenever you see Maikel with OÜ I mean the company, <strong>not me</strong>. OÜ is Estonian for LTD, it’s the legal full name of the company Maikel Limited = Maikel OÜ. I registered the company in Estonian for the simpified bureacracy</em>*</p>\n<p>My other thought while on my morning escape. The point is <strong>time</strong>, Maikel OÜ is in the business of trading time. What do I mean?</p>\n<p>My company is a funnel, a closed one. I trade on the effiency of the use of time. Companies pay me to do something for them they don’t have the time, patience, to do, for <strong>much less</strong> than will cost them in either time, money or both to be done by them. My skillset and ability to increase it quickly, is their efficiency. This in terms translates in money that translates the other way, hence, the closed loop, in time I get to spend not worrying about how do I feed myself, but reading books, doing courses, increasing my skillset, increasing <strong>the efficiency at which I can produce that time they save</strong>. Doing the courses, increasing my skillset is what makes me happy, this is why I’m into IT, because what makes me happy does actually save others time, headaches <strong>and money</strong>. </p>\n<p>I’m going to have to learn Minio inside out (not necessarily but I know I will) to create a simple automation of development of a 3-node cluster and I’m eager to begin not because of the money I’ll earn (which is laughable and buys me very little time) but because of the pleasure I know I’ll derive from the learning of this and the extra pleasure I know I will get from knowing doing something I love will solve someone else’s problem. </p>\n<p>That’s my selling point. </p>\n<p>Which means I’ll never be a big company. Maikel OÜ will never expand. In the far future it might have someone doing secretarial bits, so I can get rid of Xolo, and that person might be in charge of bring business in, but I won’t grow, I will always be a small business since my dedication is on both time saved for my clients and time obtained for my learning. I might and surely will collaborate with others, that’s the whole idea of getting work through referrals (which is on itself not easy, you <strong>must be good</strong> to get those referrals), I don’t want to grow. </p>\n<p>I want my clients to grow. </p>\n<p>I want them to think of me for their problems while they grow. </p>\n<p>I want to build business <strong>loyalty</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"company-has-now-eu-vat-id\">Company has now EU Vat ID</h2>\n<p>I don’t have to apply for EU Vat ID because as per Estonian law, I don’t have to pay VAT until I reach 40 thousand euros per year. That means all my invoices are vatless. \nBut that doesn’t mean I can’t apply earlier. It is not illegal to have VAT ID before I need it. It is only Xolo, my accountants, that prefer we don’t as that means more paperwork for them. For me it makes no difference since it’s included in what I pay them every month. </p>\n<p>I was about to lose some work due to not having a VAT ID so I applied for it and now in theory Maikel OÜ has VAT ID EE102644089</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mkl.lol/files/291d1c4d-a75b-4386-8627-b142217dfe09\" alt=\"Vat ID\"  data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure> </p>\n<p>And I say in theory because that number seems to not have propagated yet, I guess it might take a couple of days because when I search it in <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/#/vat-validation\">this database</a> it still shows as non-valid. </p>\n<h3 id=\"update\">Update:</h3>\n<p>Got a message form Kadri from xolo, the VAT ID number is valid from next Wednesday (the 15th). </p>\n<h2 id=\"back-in-paypal\">Back in Paypal</h2>\n<p>I’m back in Paypal with the account <a href=\"https://paypal.me/maikelthedev\">@maikelthedev</a> . I don’t like Paypal at all for company payments but for personal donations is not that bad. </p>\n<p>I’m adding it to the website donations page but I don’t know how quick they are at letting me withdraw the funds. It’s <a href=\"https://maikel.dev/donations\">done now</a> donating with PayPal is now an option. </p>\n<h2 id=\"developing-a-contract-writing-workflow\">Developing a contract-writing workflow</h2>\n<p>I should stop second-guessing myself because after googling “contract software” and reading….</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this <a href=\"https://www.pandadoc.com/blog/best-contract-management-software/\">https://www.pandadoc.com/blog/best-contract-management-software/</a></li>\n<li>this <a href=\"https://www.makeitfuture.com/automation/contract-generation\">https://www.makeitfuture.com/automation/contract-generation</a></li>\n<li>and this <a href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/best-apps-to-create-contract-proposal/\">https://www.makeuseof.com/best-apps-to-create-contract-proposal/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>…what I ultimately learnt is that I already had the best eSigning tool for the job. Hellosign or now called Dropbox Sign. </p>\n<p>So I’ve created a contract model based on this one and the one of Survation in Word document. All I have to do is to edit the clauses. That document is on my Netxdrive. </p>\n<p>So the best tool is actually LibreOffice. Well process done. In the future I’d like to have this all automated on my website. </p>\n<p>This is all for today. </p>\n",

You have 3, your sans, serif and mono but you can change those 3 to whatever you want. </p>\n<p>Alignment is pretty easy: text-right, text-center, text-left. </p>\n<p>Underline comes with: decoration-doble (two underlines), decoiration-dotted, even decoration-wavy. </p>\n<h4 id=\"layout--position\">Layout &amp; Position</h4>\n<p>You can make fun stuff like absolute right within a parent container with “absolute bottom-0 right-0 bg-yellow-100”</p>\n<p>intset is one interesting class. More <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/top-right-bottom-left\">here</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"backgrounds--shadows\">Backgrounds &amp; Shadows</h4>\n<p>You can use shadow-lg, shadow-xl, for the border. \nFor the inside, you can use shadow-inner or even shadow-blue for cololurs. </p>\n<p>This might make snese for the logo. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-3-tailwind-fundamentals---part-2\">Section 3: Tailwind Fundamentals - part 2</h2>\n<h4 id=\"interactivity\">Interactivity</h4>\n<p>You can add “hover:whatever” and describe the change or “focus:” or “active:”. </p>\n<p>You use group when you want multiple elements to change at the same time, you add group class to the parent and to the children “group-hover:whatever” for example. </p>\n<h4 id=\"colunns-and-gaps\">Colunns and gaps</h4>\n<p> You can put images in coluns with “column-4” (divide screen in 4 columns and) and gap you can have it or not with “gap-0” on the parent. </p>\n<h4 id=\"flexbox\">Flexbox</h4>\n<p>Flex creates it, flex-col puts them in columns, md:flex-row would put it in a row as you make the screen bigger. </p>\n<p>flex-wrap drops them down when full in the flexbox. </p>\n<p>It does make sense to add bg-blue-100 on each element while you’re tinkering with their location and size. </p>\n<h4 id=\"grid\">Grid</h4>\n<p>Use the grid class on the parent, then grid-cols-2 or whatever, and gap, depending on what you want, is similar to the way you use flexbox. </p>\n<p>Using col-span-2 etc I can imagine this could be useful for a dashboard. </p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.maikel.dev/media/posts/52/2023-07-03-105343_1922x1080_scrot.png\" alt=\"Grid example\" width=\"1922\" height=\"1080\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.maikel.dev/media/posts/52/responsive/2023-07-03-105343_1922x1080_scrot-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.maikel.dev/media/posts/52/responsive/2023-07-03-105343_1922x1080_scrot-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.maikel.dev/media/posts/52/responsive/2023-07-03-105343_1922x1080_scrot-md.png 768w ,https://blog.maikel.dev/media/posts/52/responsive/2023-07-03-105343_1922x1080_scrot-lg.png 1024w ,https://blog.maikel.dev/media/posts/52/responsive/2023-07-03-105343_1922x1080_scrot-xl.png 1360w ,https://blog.maikel.dev/media/posts/52/responsive/2023-07-03-105343_1922x1080_scrot-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I do tend to use X more. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He repeats again and again, but do not explain why. This course is trash. </p>\n<h4 id=\"transition\">Transition</h4>\n<p>Add transition-colours with duration-1000 for 1 second.

Adding less classes when you code. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-5-tailwind-css-mini-projects\">Section 5: TailWind CSS Mini-Projects</h2>\n<h4 id=\"order\">Order</h4>\n<p>Start with padding, then alignment, then size, then adapt to other screens, then transofrmations (hover, focus, active…etc). </p>\n<p>It’s good practice to start mobile first. </p>\n<h4 id=\"text-effects\">Text-effects</h4>\n<p>Use line-through to get it scratched out and inline-block when you want it to have a background that only covers the text. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-6-project-1---clipboard-website\">Section 6: Project 1 - Clipboard website</h2>\n<p>From here you could take the Hero section configuration. \nThe goal is really to create stuff in tailwind.config.js once you have a clear layout so you don’t have to repeat yourself afterwards and just focus on the content. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-7891011\">Section 7,8,9,10,11:</h2>\n<p>Nevermind this course is bullshit.

Beware a fetch should have a useEffect to avoid running for all eternity. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import {useState] from &quot;react&quot;\n\nconst [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);\n\n// Then on the fetch function change it to call setIsLoading(false)\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"using-useeffect-to-avoid-runnning-loops\">Using useEffect to avoid runnning loops</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">useEffect(() =&gt; {\n            fetch(....)\n        }, \n        [isLoading ] // Check the values on this array before executing the rest of the effect (the fetch), so in this case isLoading won&#39;t execute again.

If you want to create a folder the main one should be called index.js and all others will be subpages of that main one (whose name is the folder name).</p>\n<p>For stuff that’s dinamic use folders and filenames with [id] or [client]</p>\n<p>You could also use […slug] for pages that are of a blog (slug can be anything) or any Catch-all routes</p>\n<h4 id=\"link-advantages\">Link advantages</h4>\n<p>By using link it prefetches anything from the link as soon as you hoover it. </p>\n<h4 id=\"navigate-programatically\">Navigate programatically</h4>\n<p>Use router.push(‘theroute’) to go and be able to go back\nUse router.replace(‘theroute’) to go but without being able to go back. </p>\n<h4 id=\"custom-made-404-page\">Custom made 404 page.</h4>\n<p>Just make a 404.js page on the pages folder, give it whatever name you want and it is what will be shown.</p>\n<p>I wonder how long until he explains componentisation so I can design a navigation menu. So far it seems as if every page is its own page. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-4-working-with-file-based-routing\">Section 4: Working with file-based routing</h2>\n<p>If you hae two pages in the same folder and one of them is [eventId] and the other is […slug] the first one will only be picked up as far as the user types the URL with just 1 varaialble, more than one will pick up the second page.</p>\n<p>Create a foldr called components to store all the bits and pieces normal of Angular/React. You can call it whatever you want but that way won’t interfere with file-based pages. </p>\n<p>To use eventId on the example about</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const router = useRouter();\nconst eventId = router.query.eventId;\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"wrapping-it-all-in-a-layout-with-a-header-and-footer\">Wrapping it all in a Layout with a header and footer.</h4>\n<p>Modify _app.js to be wrapped in a Layout wrapper component that has props.children on it. </p>\n<p>I’m not exactly getting what a Fragment is. Ok I get it now thanks to <a href=\"https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment\">this</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"section-5-page-pre-rendering-and-data-fetching\">Section 5: Page Pre-Rendering and Data Fetching</h2>\n<p>This is about SSR (server-side rendering) which is the key feature of NextJs. </p>\n<p>NextJS have to types of pre-rendering, static generation and SSR on the fly. </p>\n<h4 id=\"using-getstaticprops\">Using getStaticProps()</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">export async function getStaticProps(context) {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The function must be written exactly like that and it’ll only execute on the server, never on the client, in fact it’ll be hidden from the client. There’s no window object. You can put DB code there for example. Or read from a filesystem file (useful for markdown or JSON for example). Use the FS module with async/await. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#promise-example\">https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#promise-example</a></p>\n<p>It should return {props: whateverObject}</p>\n<p>You can tell that function to work again on </p>\n<p>You can say it with the props that you return, example</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">return {\n        props: someObject, \n        revalidate: 10 // This would be th enumber of seconds to revalidate. \n        }\n</code></pre>\n<p>That’s incremental static regeneration. </p>\n<h4 id=\"using-redirect\">Using redirect.</h4>\n<p>It’s another key inside getStaticProps where you coudl specify where to send the user in case the page didn’t load or the access to the DB didn’t work for any reason. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">return {\n    redirect: &#39;/404-nodata\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"extracting-context-for-ssr\">Extracting context for SSR.</h4>\n<p>Instead of route.query.eventId (just recycling the example above, you’d use inside the getStaticProps this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">export async function getStaticProps(context) {\n    const { params } = context;\n    const eventId = params.eventId;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"using-getstaticpath\">Using getStaticPath()</h4>\n<p>Default behavior for dynamic pages is not to generate them, such as [eventId]</p>\n<pre><code>export async function getStaticPaths() {\n    return {\n        paths: [\n                {params: {eventId: &quot;1&quot;} }\n                {params: {eventId: &quot;2&quot;} }\n                {params: {eventId: &quot;3&quot;} }\n        ],\n        fallback: false\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"using-fallback-true\">Using fallback: true</h4>\n<p>Using fallback set to true stuff is generated before when first visited. Imagine one as before but with eventId:4. When using this you should put a loading page or something because nothing will be created no the first visit yet. </p>\n<h4 id=\"not-found\">Not found</h4>\n<p>You can return {notFound: true} to send the user to a 404 Not found page in the absence of a product with the ID the user request for example. </p>\n<h4 id=\"using-getserversideprops\">Using getServerSideProps()</h4>\n<p>This one is never statically pre-generated. You get access to params, req and res. Yoo cannot use it with getStaticProps because it wouldn’t make any sense. </p>\n<pre><code>export async function getServerSideProps(context) {\nconst {params, req, res} = context\nreturns { props: thePropsObject} \n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"whats-useswr-hook\">What’s useSWR hook.</h4>\n<p>Is one to use instead of useEffect() to get data from the client side. Just check the docs. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-6-project-time-page-pre-rendering--data-fetching\">Section 6: Project Time: Page Pre-rendering &amp; Data Fetching</h2>\n<p>If you set fallback to blocking on any of the functions of the previous section nothing will be generated until the generation of the data has finished. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-7-optimizing-nextjs-apps\">Section 7: Optimizing NextJS Apps</h2>\n<h4 id=\"the-head-component\">THe head component.</h4>\n<p>It is na import from NetxJS. It works to add stuff between Head tags. You could use it with the _app.js file to have a generic head for all pages. </p>\n<p>If you use the same Head thing in different places with the same values, it takes the later one. </p>\n<h4 id=\"the-_documentjs-file\">The _document.js file</h4>\n<p>I don’t think you’ll ever need this one but if you do check direclty <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/25145892#overview\">this</a> video. It is useful if you want to change the HTML document itself. </p>\n<h4 id=\"optmising-images\">Optmising images</h4>\n<p>This is interesting. Using the Image component NextJS will optimise on the fly the image. Width and Height are mandatory when using this one. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-8-adding-backend-code-with-api-routes-fullstack-react\">Section 8: Adding Backend Code with API Routes (Fullstack React)</h2>\n<p>The code inside “api” won’t ever go to the client. </p>\n<h4 id=\"you-must-use-the-api-folder\">You must use the API folder</h4>\n<p>NextJS requires that if you use an API it has the folder named “api”. \nIt’s very similar to vanilla express but also uses the pages file-based format. So if you want a users api endpoint you just create a users.js file inside “api” folder and inside, similar as express:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function handler(req, res) {\n    res.status(200\n        .json({status: &quot;ok&quot;})\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"communication-front-end-backend\">Communication front-end backend</h4>\n<p>If you’re going to use getStaticProps from the frontend then you shouldn’t use fetch since it’s all in your project. Instead you should DRY and make the code you have in your API a function that can be accessed from getStaticProps()</p>\n<h2 id=\"section-9-project-time-api-routes\">Section 9: Project Time: API Routes</h2>\n<p>Not much on this section that I need to write down….Talks a lot about Mongo DB which I know inside out since I used it to model the data of the Survation Panel. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-10-working-with-app-wide-state-react-context\">Section 10: Working with App-wide State (React Context)</h2>\n<p>Nothing special here, it is the same as ContextProviders before…. .</p>\n<h2 id=\"section-11-complete-app-example-build-a-full-blog-a-to-z\">Section 11: Complete App Example: Build a Full Blog A to Z</h2>\n<p>The only bit that’s interesting here is about converting markdown, since you could use it if you get tired of Publii, the current software I’m using for this blog you’re seeing. </p>\n<h4 id=\"image-layout-property\">Image layout property</h4>\n<p>Setting the layout property of an image as “responsive” it’ll fill up the container where it is. </p>\n<h4 id=\"translating-markdown-to-jsx\">Translating MarkDown to JSX</h4>\n<p>Use <a href=\"https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown\">react-markdown</a>, it takes markdown and outputs it as JSX. </p>\n<p>A common approach is to have a folder named “content”. You use gray matter to add metadata to markdown</p>\n<p>UUse another package too called <a href=\"https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter\">gray-matter</a></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">----\ntitle: Some title\ndate: 2022-20-15\nauthor: yourself\nexcerpt: ....\nimage: ....\n----\n\nAnd here the markdown\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can use <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/25146246#overview\">this</a> video as reference. </p>\n<h4 id=\"getstaticprops-needs-getstaticpath\">getStaticProps needs getStaticPath</h4>\n<p>This is the case for all the pages that are dynamically created. </p>\n<h4 id=\"rendering-images\">Rendering images</h4>\n<p>Change ReactMarkdown to render img tags as Images in NextJS with customRenderers</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const customRenderers = {\t\t\n        paragraph(paragraph) {\n        const { node} = paragraph\n        if (node.children[0].type === &quot;image&#39;) {\n        const image = node.children[0];\n        return &lt;div className={classes.image}&gt;\n            &lt;Image src={image.src} alt={image.alt} width={image.with} height={image.height}/&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            .....\n            }\n            return &lt;p&gt;{paragraph.children}&lt;/p&gt;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"code-snippets-in-colours\">Code snippets in colours</h4>\n<p>Same, override the above with </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter\">React-syntax-highlighter</a> is the package you’ll need. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-12-deploying-nextjs-apps\">Section 12: Deploying NextJS Apps</h2>\n<h4 id=\"next-export\">Next Export</h4>\n<p>It’s just a command that creates a 100% full static app and doesnt’ require a NodeJS server. But that means you cannot use API routes, server-side pages, nor page revalidations. </p>\n<h4 id=\"nextconfigjs\">next.config.js</h4>\n<p>It’s better to just <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js\">check the docs</a> for this. It has hundreds of options. </p>\n<h4 id=\"optimising-prism-syntax-highlighter\">Optimising Prism (syntax highlighter)</h4>\n<p>Choose only the languages you want to import. </p>\n<h2 id=\"section-13-adding-authentication\">Section 13: Adding Authentication</h2>\n<p>You  could use this to share post pages that are unlisted. You already know everything about JSON Web Tokens. </p>\n<p>You could also use this to connect blog posts to projects to clients if clients had their own logins. That would also allow them to access a Dashboard with information of how their project goes: hours used, links to artifacts, contracts, </p>\n<h4 id=\"nextauth\">NextAuth</h4>\n<p>Is like PassportJs. <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/25146422#overview\">This</a> video explains it better how it works but you’d rather, if you ever use it, go to the documentation. </p>\n<h4 id=\"usesession\">useSession</h4>\n<p>You imoprt it from next-auth/client and gives you {session, logging} from useSession. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const {session, logging} = useSession();\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"signout\">SignOut</h4>\n<p>Tha’ts another function from next-auth/client to sign out.</p>\n<h4 id=\"page-guards-client-side\">Page Guards (client side)</h4>\n<p>I prefer the server-side part. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import {getSession} from &#39;next-auth/client&#39;;\n\ngetSession().then(() =&gt; loading=true))\n\nif (loading) {\n    // do whatever\n    else {\n    // do whatever\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"page-guards-server-side\">Page Guards (server side)</h4>\n<p>You’d obviously need getServerSideProps because this can’t be static. </p>\n<p>It’s very simple, just get if the uer is logged and pass the session, otherwise redirect them elsewhere (to the /auth page)</p>\n<h2 id=\"done\">Done!</h2>\n<p>The two final sections are a summary and a round up so no need to do them.

            "content_html": "<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>If I were in London I would know exactly what to do and when. I'd start by checking Reed.co.uk, CW-Jobs and other jobsites to have a good grasp of what's available when doing simple searches. But by no means would I believe what I've seen there as representative of what is truly available. It's just an appetizer.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Jobsites are not even the tip of the iceberg. Most jobs are filled without them ever being posted on the internet. Someone at the company knows someone, who knows someone and is in the right place at the right time.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Being <strong>in the right place </strong>on <strong>the right time. </strong>This is what gets you the job you want. And that was my strategy in Andorra in 2007. So today I'm gathering knowledge from the past to see how can I apply it right now in El Puerto. My life is different, my skillset <strong>vastly </strong>different for starters I have one, therefore the type of job I can afford to get <strong>today </strong>is nowhere similar to the very limited options I had 15 years ago.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>My strategy in Andorra was to be <strong>ubiquitous</strong>. It wasn't hard to be honest, just need to know a vast amount of people in a tiny city and ensure they all know what you're looking for, that you're available and how to contact you. That country is tiny, so contacting the HR manager of every known company wasn't really hard, most of them are literally working in the same street (Meritxell Avenue, the only High Street of Andorra/Escaldes). Gathering the information to know who was who, maybe that was harder. Internet wasn't in 2007 what it is today. Today you can just open Linkedin to know who is in charge of hiring on every company.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>My strategy in London, couldn't be the same, because London, unlike Andorra, isn't tiny. You can only be ubiquitous in London if you're the Queen. So there my strategy was to be known by the right companies. It involved more research about where was each located, who was in charge of hiring and what they were into. London was the hardest and yet luck was a very big factor. It was a couple of key people who got me the foot on the door.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Seville was maybe, the simplest. In the UK you can't just walk into a company and say \"hi, I'm hireable, here is my CV\", but Andalusia is the opposite, you can literally just do that. No one would use GDPR as an excuse to avoid taking your CV, people are nosy and bored at work.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In Seville, in 2010 my approach was to locate in the map a couple of <strong>high density </strong>business centres. One was the 5 towers of Nuevo Torneo, followed by the other 6 towers nearby. The other was the 4 to 5 contiguous office buildings just after entering East Seville. I literally walked, with 20 copies of my CV made for every possible job I could imagine I was good at, generic but not too generic, I was looking for office and IT-oriented jobs, and handed it over to the hiring manager on every office. If he or she wasn't there I didn't waste paper. I put emphasis on the 20 copies because it is probably no more than it took me to start working for Clearwire.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Hiring is a game of putting yourself in the shoes of the hiring manager. From their perspective, you're being <strong>auctioned</strong>. They know you're hireable for a <strong>very</strong> limited time, once you find a job you're out of the market. Their opportunity is lost, your talent is elsewhere.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In the UK being ubiquitous requires an online presence. Emails back and forth to the right people at the right companies. Too much networking.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>El Puerto is, weird. It's a strange city that I can't place nor compare to any of the other places I've been. It has an industry but I can't figure the size of it, it is <strong>not </strong>only dedicated to tourism, even though that's the appearance it kind of gives.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>One of the companies that has eScooters for hire is based in this city, I can't figure out why when they don't even offer that service here. They were only operating in Seville and Cádiz (the capital city, not the province). More and more companies are taking up space in the Salinas business area nearby my home. I wonder how cheap or convenient is the square metre there. In a nutshell, El Puerto has the appearance of non-tourism orientated <strong>growth </strong>and if I can, for once, be part of that I would love to.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I run away from this city in 2007, never looked back, gave it for lost, accepted all jobs that could be taken in this city were in the waitressing industry. But now, so many years later, I have the strong feeling that has changed and this city may be becoming the economic engine of the Bay. Which sounds exciting because it means I might be able to settle down back in my hometown.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Sure, London is exciting, travelling wherever, living in Barcelona, or having the right to work in Andorra (which isn't easy at all) makes you feel special but....I never wanted special. I want, <strong>home</strong>. The place where my body is accustomed to its weather, the place where the food is what I've grown up eating, the place where family and most friends are. The place I want to have <strong>a mortgage</strong> in.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So here I am, this is what I had:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:list --></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remote working 24/7</li>\n<li>My own schedule organised by me.</li>\n<li>I could choose what tech to use for each page, service, website.
