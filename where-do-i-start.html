I'd start by checking Reed.co.uk, CW-Jobs and other jobsites to have a good grasp of what's available when doing simple searches. But by no means would I believe what I've seen there as representative of what is truly available. It's just an appetizer.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jobsites are not even the tip of the iceberg. Most jobs are filled without them ever being posted on the internet. Someone at the company knows someone, who knows someone and is in the right place at the right time.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Being <strong>in the right place </strong>on <strong>the right time. </strong>This is what gets you the job you want. And that was my strategy in Andorra in 2007. So today I'm gathering knowledge from the past to see how can I apply it right now in El Puerto. My life is different, my skillset <strong>vastly </strong>different for starters I have one, therefore the type of job I can afford to get <strong>today </strong>is nowhere similar to the very limited options I had 15 years ago.</p><p></p><p></p><p>My strategy in Andorra was to be <strong>ubiquitous</strong>. It wasn't hard to be honest, just need to know a vast amount of people in a tiny city and ensure they all know what you're looking for, that you're available and how to contact you. That country is tiny, so contacting the HR manager of every known company wasn't really hard, most of them are literally working in the same street (Meritxell Avenue, the only High Street of Andorra/Escaldes). Gathering the information to know who was who, maybe that was harder. Internet wasn't in 2007 what it is today. Today you can just open Linkedin to know who is in charge of hiring on every company.</p><p></p><p></p><p>My strategy in London, couldn't be the same, because London, unlike Andorra, isn't tiny. You can only be ubiquitous in London if you're the Queen. So there my strategy was to be known by the right companies. It involved more research about where was each located, who was in charge of hiring and what they were into. London was the hardest and yet luck was a very big factor. It was a couple of key people who got me the foot on the door.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Seville was maybe, the simplest. In the UK you can't just walk into a company and say "hi, I'm hireable, here is my CV", but Andalusia is the opposite, you can literally just do that. No one would use GDPR as an excuse to avoid taking your CV, people are nosy and bored at work.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In Seville, in 2010 my approach was to locate in the map a couple of <strong>high density </strong>business centres. One was the 5 towers of Nuevo Torneo, followed by the other 6 towers nearby. The other was the 4 to 5 contiguous office buildings just after entering East Seville. I literally walked, with 20 copies of my CV made for every possible job I could imagine I was good at, generic but not too generic, I was looking for office and IT-oriented jobs, and handed it over to the hiring manager on every office. If he or she wasn't there I didn't waste paper. I put emphasis on the 20 copies because it is probably no more than it took me to start working for Clearwire.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Hiring is a game of putting yourself in the shoes of the hiring manager. From their perspective, you're being <strong>auctioned</strong>. They know you're hireable for a <strong>very</strong> limited time, once you find a job you're out of the market. Their opportunity is lost, your talent is elsewhere.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the UK being ubiquitous requires an online presence. Emails back and forth to the right people at the right companies. Too much networking.</p><p></p><p></p><p>El Puerto is, weird. It's a strange city that I can't place nor compare to any of the other places I've been. It has an industry but I can't figure the size of it, it is <strong>not </strong>only dedicated to tourism, even though that's the appearance it kind of gives.</p><p></p><p></p><p>One of the companies that has eScooters for hire is based in this city, I can't figure out why when they don't even offer that service here. They were only operating in Seville and CÃ¡diz (the capital city, not the province). More and more companies are taking up space in the Salinas business area nearby my home. I wonder how cheap or convenient is the square metre there. In a nutshell, El Puerto has the appearance of non-tourism orientated <strong>growth </strong>and if I can, for once, be part of that I would love to.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I run away from this city in 2007, never looked back, gave it for lost, accepted all jobs that could be taken in this city were in the waitressing industry. But now, so many years later, I have the strong feeling that has changed and this city may be becoming the economic engine of the Bay. Which sounds exciting because it means I might be able to settle down back in my hometown.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Sure, London is exciting, travelling wherever, living in Barcelona, or having the right to work in Andorra (which isn't easy at all) makes you feel special but....I never wanted special. I want, <strong>home</strong>. The place where my body is accustomed to its weather, the place where the food is what I've grown up eating, the place where family and most friends are. The place I want to have <strong>a mortgage</strong> in.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So here I am, this is what I had:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Remote working 24/7</li><li>My own schedule organised by me.</li><li>I could choose what tech to use for each page, service, website. Including what programming language and framework.</li><li>A salary that allowed me to not worry about money.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>This is what I offer now:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Don't care about remote or going to an office. Unless the office has air conditioning in which case I prefer it.</li><li>Knowledge of Python, JavaScript, back-end &amp; front-end frameworks. Self-directed learning whenever I need some extra knowledge on anything.</li><li>An upper second-class honours degree on Computing and IT by the Open University.</li><li>A brain that never stops.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>This is what I want now:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Permanency. I don't want more project work, more fixed date work. I want my new job to be my last job. The one I'll do all the way to my retirement.</li><li>In the Cadiz Bay.</li><li>I want an amount of fixed hours per week. No more 24/7 monitoring of website A, B, C running smoothly and having to be no more than 1km away from my laptop to fix anything at 3am looking at Nagios/Sensu.</li><li>Clear definition of my duties. I don't want to run ever again an entire software engineering department. It's bad for my skillset.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated
